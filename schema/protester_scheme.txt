Instructions: Highlight text that describes the time, location, and all the actions of a protester-initiated event occurring during the Occupy movement. Remember, a protester-initiated event is one that protesters plan or lead, AND that is not in direct immediate response to an event initiated by the police/government. Some protester activities occur during events that police initiate, and those protester activities should be highlighted as a part of a POLICE-initiated event. If more than one protester-initiated event is described in the article, be sure to indicate each instance by adjusting the case number on the highlight flag to indicate each separate event.
