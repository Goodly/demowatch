The confusion began when Murman received her first be aware after her redemption duration ended. "I acquired a observe on the door that they wanted to be aware of who used to be living there and what the plans were," recalled Murman. "I called and talked to a gal named Jen Crockett. She asked our scenario and I said we without a doubt need about forty five days to be out."
Although Jennifer Crocket used to be the contact name on the notice, Crockett did not work at once for U.S. Bank. She works for Keller Williams Realty, which had been dealing with Murman's foreclosures as a 0.33 birthday celebration for GMAC, and it used to be via Crockett that Murman acquired records about her foreclosures situation.
Crockett sympathized with the situation, according to Murman, and advised her she'd contact U.S. Bank and let her know if there was once some thing else Murman needed to know or do two but that used to be the solely time she heard from Crockett.
