Occupy San Francisco protesters arrested after taking over Bank of America;
Police arrested ratings of anti-Wall Street protesters in San Francisco on Wednesday after they occupied a Bank of America branch in the city's economic district.
Demonstrators flooded into the bank at some point of an organised march that began at the protesters' downtown encampment and ended at a kingdom workplace constructing a few blocks away.
The group set up a tent internal the bank branch as extra than one hundred bystanders watched from backyard and police in rebellion helmets arrested the occupiers one by using one, bringing them to a waiting bus.
One protester waved a signal inside that study "make banks pay." Another held up a signal to a neighborhood tv station that stated they were protesting the link between California's public greater training device and the banks.
The protesters chanted "we are the 99 per cent" as they were arrested, alluding to the richest 1 per cent of the U.S. populace that the activists say control a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth and power.
Officer Albie Esparza, a police department spokesman, said 95 demonstrators had been arrested in connection with Wednesday's bank protest, most on suspicion of trespassing. He said there have been "no claims of harm on both side."
