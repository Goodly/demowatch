Occupy Huntington protesters are being evicted from their camp in the front of a downtown bank.
Media shops document that Mayor Kim Wolfe issued an eviction word to the team Wednesday afternoon. Occupy Huntington has until 4 p.m. Thursday to vacate the camp in the front of the Chase Bank Building.
Occupy Huntington set up the encampment in mid-October.
Wolfe says metropolis officers want to uphold the group's right to collect but there are protection concerns. They encompass violations of the city's furnace prevention code.
Police Chief Skip Holbrook says the group has been cooperative in the previous and he would not expect problems when police implement the mayor's notice.
Occupy Huntington protester Joseph Iorio says the group is disheartened and upset but the motion isn't always over.
