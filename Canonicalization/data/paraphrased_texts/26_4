DATELINE: SAN DIEGO


Anti-Wall Street demonstrators in San Diego have shaped a human chain around a tent in a downtown plaza the place they've camped out for a week and are refusing police orders to take it down.
Police on Friday started getting rid of about a half-dozen tents after warning demonstrators that their non-public property could not remain in the Occupy San Diego camp.
Authorities say demonstrators can proceed protesting barring the tents, tarps and tables.
Lt. Andra Brown says one man used to be arrested for interfering with a police officer after he sat down and refused to take away his tent.
After he and his tent were removed, different demonstrators re-erected a tent and are defending it.
The protest is in sympathy with demonstrations in New York and different cities to protest corporate have an impact on on politics.
