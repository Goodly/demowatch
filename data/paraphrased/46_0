Occupation of Providence is underway
Hundreds rally against corporate greed

Hundreds of people have converged on Burnside Park in the capital city. Organizers of Occupy Providence say they desire to provide voice to disenfranchised Rhode Islanders, and combat returned towards what they see as corporate greed.
The rally quickly evolved into a march thru the city. Many protesters carried symptoms studying "We are the 99%". They declare they may remain camped in the park for as long as it takes to change environment on Wall Street, and in Washington, DC.
"99 percentage of us do not make a million dollars a year, don't have one million in assets. It seems to many people that the device diagram is managed through that 1 percent," Jared Paul of Providence told Eyewitness News.
Unofficial estimates put the crowd round four hundred people.
"It's no longer just younger children here. The 99 percent, it's each and every age and each nationality. I just prefer people to wake up," Kina King of Narragansett said.
Providence police say they respect the people's constitutional right to assembly, but will only permit them in the park for forty eight hours. After that, the Occupy Providence movement will want a allow from the city.
