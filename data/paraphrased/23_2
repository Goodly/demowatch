DATELINE: RICHMOND Va.


Protesters are refusing to do away with tents from a downtown Richmond park notwithstanding police warnings that they're breaking the law.
About 25 tents had been in vicinity Wednesday at Kanawha Plaza. Protesters with the Occupy Richmond movement, an offshoot of the economy-driven Occupy Wall Street protest in New York, began their demonstration Saturday.
After Richmond police cautioned protesters to do away with the tents, the American Civil Liberties Union wrote a letter asking Mayor Dwight Jones to let the campers stay. Jones has stated he supports the group's right to freedom of expression, however he has a responsibility to ensure that activities in the town are lawful.
The protesters' police liaison, Bill Nelson, says it's up to every man or woman to determine whether or not to dispose of his or her tent.
No arrests have been made.
