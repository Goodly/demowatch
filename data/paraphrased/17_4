Protesters tied their message to the holiday.
"Christmas in a lot of methods defines a lot of the problems that we're facing," stated one protester. "It's a very isolating time for people, in particular this yr when human beings have had properties forclosed and lost their jobs and all that kind of stuff."
"Focus on giving, focus on family, center of attention on friends," stated every other protester when asked what Christmas skill to him. "Think beyond the cash and all the top toys, and simply take into account that we're humans and we need to suppose about every different first."
While attendance at the day's early activities was once sparse, protesters stated they predicted extra humans to participate in the evening's deliberate activities, which were scheduled to encompass a communion, storytelling and music.
