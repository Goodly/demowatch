About 40 to 50 police officers watched on.\nJustin Robert Honea was charged with prohibited activity in a public park. Nine other people were arrested on trespassing charges. Their names are below.\nProtesters were told by Mayor Joe Riley on Monday that they were not allowed to occupy Marion Square after the park closed at 11 p.m. Riley told the protesters they could stay in the park for seven days and only during daylight hours, but the protesters weren't happy.\nOccupiers took to the streets Tuesday night in a last-ditch effort, to raise awareness about social and economic inequality, turning a peaceful park into a restless one.\nAccording to a spokesperson for the City of Charleston, protesters for Occupy Charleston addressed the city council Tuesday during a 30-minute open forum to the public. Supposedly, nothing came out of that meeting.\nThe occupy movement has cost local taxpayers nationwide at least $13 million since the protests began, according to an associated press survey. The survey looked at data from government agencies in 18 cities with active protests through Nov. 15. Most of the costs come from law enforcement needing to monitor marches and evict protesters.\nCopyright WCSC 2011.

Many of us feel the people\u2019s voice is no longer being heard.\u201d\nHayes alleged the Occupy movement focused on Wall Street because bankers and corporations have purchased politicians and all the rights and privileges of a human being with none of the responsibilities.\nBeth Foster, of Cleveland, said a decision on how visible the local protest will be depends on conclusions made by a general assembly of the participants. The assembly is designed so there is no hierarchy or leadership and everyone\u2019s voice is heard.\nThe goal, she said, is to get money out of politics.\n\u201cWe want to own our government again,\u201d she said. \u201cThe American people no longer own the government.\u201d\nFoster said they might decide to occupy a space in Cleveland at some point in the future, but most of the locals are working with Occupy Chattanooga.\n\u201cWe may be doing the actual occupation with them, but what we want people to know is there is a presence in Cleveland,\u201d she said.\nFoster said Occupy has been compared to the tea party movement that sprang up prior to the last presidential election. The difference is that Occupy is not a political party. It is neither left nor right, Democrat nor Republican.\n\u201cSome of the political action committees affiliated with the Democratic Party have tried to move in on Occupy. The Democrats are as much a part of the problem as the Republicans. This is a nonpartisan movement,\u201d she said.\nHayes said they are a very loosely formed, leaderless organization protesting against corporate greed and corruption.\n\u201cWe support freedom, equality, justice and liberty,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are being oppressed. There have been police atrocities across the country and we should absolutely have the freedom to assemble as we please, when we please in public areas.\u201d\nFoster said a desired outcome has not been established.\n\u201cThere is not necessarily an end that has been established yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are going through a dialoguing process to get to that end.\u201d\nHayes has been participating in Occupy Chattanooga and planned to return to Chattanooga later in the evening to stay overnight on the lawn at City Hall.\n\u201cWe are not going anywhere. We have the First Amendment right to assemble and it does not limit us to any time schedule or city ordinance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is our constitutional right to assemble in nonviolent protest.\u201d\nHayes believes refusal of two Nashville magistrates to uphold the arrests of 29 protesters on Oct. 29, and 26 people on Oct. 30, based on a curfew put in place on Oct. 28, sets a legal precedent.\nThe Cleveland protesters are part of the Occupy movement, which began in lower Manhattan as Occupy Wall Street to decry corporate influence in government and wealth inequality. It has spread to cities large and small across the country and around the world.\nBreann Murray Tolley and her husband own Clover Wreath Farm where they grow organic products in Cleveland. She is concerned about corruption and food security.\n\u201cA substantial amount of the federal budget goes to large corporate farms that do not have our health or our environment (in mind). I would really like to see the money given to small, sustainable farms so we can keep food more local and more sustainable,\u201d she said.\nChad Jones, a sophomore at Cleveland State Community College, left the Navy only to find his military education and practical experience were disregarded, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t have a piece of paper.\u201d\nMatthew Deniston, of Cleveland, is a member of the Georgia National Guard who has deployed twice each to Iraq and Afghanistan. He is concerned about waste and fraud in the military.\nAccording to the Occupy Wall Street website, it is \u201ca resistance movement with people of many colors, genders and political persuasions. The one thing we all have in common is that We Are The 99 percent that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1 percent. We are using the revolutionary Arab Spring tactic to achieve our ends and encourage the use of nonviolence to maximize the safety of all participants.\u201d\nwho marched around the Bradley County Courthouse Sunday afternoon protesting the \u201cEqual Access to Public Property Act of 2012\u201d authored by State Rep. Eric Watson, R-Cleveland representing the 22nd Legislative District. Members of the Occupy Movement say the bill makes homelessness a crime. Csapo said hundreds of thousands of working class families have been thrown out of their homes. He charged the foreclosure policies in the United States are the extraction of wealth from the working class. There is not a jump in homeless so much as there is a jump in \u201cun-homed\u201d people, he explained. There are more empty houses than there are homeless families, he said.

The victim was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment, police said.\nNicholson, who police said lives in Halethorpe, was charged with first-degree assault and was being held on $75,000 bond. According to court records, she does not have a prior criminal record.\nThe Occupy protest, a local offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement that seeks to call attention to income inequality and other issues, recently reached its two month anniversary. But it has struggled at times deal with a dwindling number of core leaders, the seemingly imminent threat of eviction, and allegations of crime and drug use among some who have frequented the encampment.\nOrganizer Annemarie Rush said the victim and suspect have been staying at the site for \u201cquite some time, but they are not considered to be active participants in our greater goals.\u201d\n\u201cWe have attracted a wide array of different parts of Baltimore, and different people who feel they have been disenfranchised,\u201d Rush said. \u201cThat also includes all of the problems that come with Baltimore and society in general.\u201d\nShe said organizers were \u201chorrified\u201d by the stabbing and said the suspect was not welcome back. \"We don\u2019t condone their actions at all,\u201d she said.\nAs police across the country have evicted protesters \u2013 in some cases leading to ugly clashes and claims of police brutality \u2013 officials here have largely taken a hands-off approach, denying permits for using the park but saying they would enforce that denial \u201cat a time of our choosing.\u201d\n\u201cThe City of Baltimore is committed to protecting individuals\u2019 right to protest. However, permanent camping is prohibited in our public parks and individuals are free to peaceably assemble and demonstrate within the currently established guidelines. The city has repeatedly communicated this to individuals on-site,\u201d said Ryan O\u2019Doherty, a spokesman for Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.\nHe added that the city would \u201cfully investigate any individual acts of dangerous criminal behavior and take immediate action.\u201d\nIn their two months at the Inner Harbor, the group has taken part in various protests and sought to spur public dialogue about social issues. One homeless recently woman told the City Council that the encampment had been \u201caccommodating in ways the city hasn\u2019t been.\u201d\nBut previous allegations of theft and assault have roiled the group. At meetings of participants, called \u201cgeneral assemblies,\u201d speakers have in the past openly questioned whether they could maintain control of the diverse community.\nRush said organizers have no plan to leave. \u201cThis is just the first step in the Occupy movement,\u201d she said.\nAn earlier version of this article quoted organizers saying the victim and suspect were still welcome at the encampment. Rush said that is not the case.\n\n\nLink:http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bal-woman-stabbed-at-occupy-baltimore-20111205,0,1089654.story", "metadata": {"city": "Baltimore", "article_number": "912", "filename": "912Baltimore-TheBaltimoreSun-01.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-05", "state": null, "version": "26", "annotators": ["EDC", "MB"], "periodical": "TheBaltimoreSun", "periodical_code": "01"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 215, "uuid": "4b4dd3ad-1e88-41d7-85e5-2b409e225ded", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 215, "uuid": "a079c153-a733-4304-a0d8-b820b24da4f0", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 1054, "uuid": "245ddd55-c286-46c4-8f2a-4c18d60aa5e6", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[2696, 2736, "In their two months at the Inner Harbor,"], [949, 968, "The Occupy protest,"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 34, "article_number": 202, "uri": "urn:article:202:ba3b47ff-99e4-4f0e-8ef8-0b05a9e2484f", "sha256": "c8b83b753ac022dae25614838cc55bd6feb4ca5a84ab199e3f145c62331bae15", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Dismay, hard feelings after confrontation\nCity leaders defend cops for Occupy Albany actions, but protesters say trust is gone\nBy JORDAN CARLEO-EVANGELIST, Staff writer\nUpdated 10:42 pm, Friday, December 23, 2011\n\n\nALBANY \u2014 On the matted, dead grass of Academy Park \u2014 where the lively Occupy Albany camp held court for eight weeks \u2014 only disappointment reigned Friday.\nDisappointment by protesters still furious over what they say was excessive force wielded a day earlier by a police department whose leader, Chief Steven Krokoff, they had previously viewed as their principled protector.\nAnd disappointment by Krokoff and other top city officials, who criticized the lack of respect shown by demonstrators and lamented having being drawn into the exact sort of physical conflict with the protesters they had sought for two months to avoid.\nKrokoff and Mayor Jerry Jennings stridently backed the actions of their officers in the bizarre tug of war Thursday over the encampment's last remaining tent \u2014 a scrum that ended with three officers injured and several members of the crowd, including a city councilman, reeling from pepper spray used by one mounted officer.\n\"Use of that pepper spray most definitely prevented serious injuries \u2014 not only to the police officers but to the other people that were in that camp,\" Krokoff said Friday morning, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Mayor Jerry Jennings. \"I'm proud of each and every member of my police department \u2014 as proud as I've ever been of them \u2014 for the work that they've done. ...the abuse that they took.\"\nRichard Gorleski, the officer who used the pepper spray, later confirmed Krokoff's account of the incident, saying he reacted only after protesters reached for the reins and bridle of his horse.\n\"If I didn't spray a few of those people, someone would have been seriously injured,\" said Gorleski, who is also president of the Albany Police Officers Union. He said officers below him were being rushed by protesters trying to keep police from restraining those clinging to the tent.\nSome protesters, however, disputed that account.\nJennings, meanwhile, contrasted the city's decision to send crews of workers into Academy Park to dismantle the two-month-old encampment after its permit expired Thursday with tactics used elsewhere.\n\"I didn't go in the middle of the night like they did in other cities,\" he said. \"They did show restraint.\"\nKrokoff's refusal to arrest the protesters after the camp first took root Oct. 21 \u2014 paired with District Attorney David Soares ' refusal to prosecute them \u2014 only boosted the chief's credibility among progressives who backed his candidacy for the job last year. That he was at the center of its unraveling served as a strange coda to the Occupy Albany encampment.\n\"I no longer trust Krokoff,\" declared Councilman Anton Konev, a one-time supporter of the chief.\nKonev has called for hearings to investigate the use of force and said using some of the city's new beat officers to dismantle the camp may have seriously damaged newly forged relationships with the community.\nCouncilman Dominick Calsalaro, who said he was grazed by the mist of pepper spray, also criticized the decision to capture the tent but laid the blame with Jennings, not Krokoff, who he said was likely just following orders.\n\"It was totally against the whole community policing philosophy, and they've destroyed relationships that they've had with the people,\" Calsolaro said. \"Nobody disrespected the police until they came in to take that tent.\"\nCity workers first entered the camp around 2 p.m. Thursday after officials won a court order barring the occupiers from continuing to spend nights there.\nBut the violence didn't flare until some three hours later, after the protesters uprooted their last tent and carried it around the city through rush-hour traffic, then returned it to the park across Washington Avenue from the state Capitol.\nProtesters maintained they had no plans to leave it there. Minutes later, however, about 30 police officers under orders from Krokoff moved in to capture it to prevent them from heading back into the streets.\nMark Mishler an attorney working with the protesters, called that the day's most fateful decision, saying that if the protesters were going to resist, they would have done so hours earlier when they linked arms and surrounded the tent before taking to the streets.\n\"The group had already essentially made a decision that they weren't going to fight to keep it in the park,\" Mishler said.\nThe hand-to-hand struggle that ensued \u2014 including the use of the pepper spray \u2014 was captured on numerous video recordings. Police first said only two protesters were sprayed, but Krokoff later acknowledged more may have been hit.\nFour people were arrested, and three police officers suffered minor injuries, Krokoff said, including one who was hospitalized overnight for complications resulting from a back injury.\nSoares said his office will review video of the skirmish to decide whether to prosecute those arrested. In a statement, he called the conflict a \"black eye\" for the city. But Jennings put the blame squarely on the protesters.\n\"I expected cooperation.

So there is no curfew on that particular piece of property. The people that are engaged in the Occupy Lubbock movement are exercising first amendment rights,\" Martin said.\nMartin said the protesters will be allowed to stay \"as long as it's not being torn up and as long as they're not causing a disturbance.\"\nBut at least one local business would like the protesters to move on.\nStaybridge Suites is right next door to the protest. The owners say they've lost several customers because of the protest and have complained to the police multiple times about protesters using their facilities. Police say they have received less than ten complaint calls from the public.\nThere are less than a dozen protesters at the 19th Street location, but they say they're in it for the long haul. They built their tent city a month ago and are making time in their work and school schedules to maintain it.\nProtester Andrew McMillan said, \"I do have a job with the radio station and I am a full time Tech student graduating in June.\"\nThe Occupy Lubbock group is determined to get its message out, using social media and making signs - using donations and their own money to maintain a presence 24/7.\nProtester Matt Fouss said, \"I just got paid on the 10th, spent about $60 dollars on sign making supplies and brought a printer out here so we can start this faces of Lubbock billboard.\"\nThe protesters are concerned about income inequality and are determined to drive the corporate influence out of politics. They have contacted Congressman Randy Neugebauer and have received responses from his assistants, which they hope will help.\n\"When the annual average income of the bottom of 90 percent is $31,000, meanwhile the top 1 percent annual average income is $1.13 million, there is a problem. That's a huge gap. It creates this illusion that people can climb their way up the ladder, when in reality it's not possible,\" McMillan said.\nWinter is coming on fast, but the protesters have winterized tents and generators. They say they're prepared to stay.\nCopyright 2011 KCBD NewsChannel 11\nLink: http://www.kcbd.com/story/16048445/mayor-says-occupy-lubbock-protesters-can-stay", "metadata": {"city": "Lubbock", "article_number": "4008", "filename": "4008Lubbock-KBCD-03.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-15", "state": null, "version": "29", "annotators": ["SLG"], "periodical": "KBCD", "periodical_code": "03"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 97, "uuid": "581589d3-13ee-410e-b92a-a25e31720b55", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 97, "uuid": "de0d3b15-fc3d-4972-a708-4ab1b0d1564f", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 431, "uuid": "d0125429-b632-4c6f-a71f-1a00e882bf3c", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[1181, 1219, "They built their tent city a month ago"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 84, "article_number": 3638, "uri": "urn:article:3638:1c913dfa-9041-42a6-af1e-8f791e3a19be", "sha256": "ffa72b44d42511726447abe5cee341c1007cd280947b0d39d5e71f404e96844b", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Occupy L.A. protesters return to downtown streets\nDecember 3, 2011 | 10:01 pm\n\n\nOccupy Los Angeles protesters returned to the streets Saturday in a large march that included many of the same demonstrators who were arrested during a police sweep of their camp outside City Hall last week.\nAt least one person was arrested during Saturday\u2019s heavily policed march in downtown L.A., apparently for failing to follow police orders to stay on the sidewalk.

In front of the memorial to Abraham Lincoln in Grant Park, a bench was hammered onto pieces of plywood to keep it from being blown over. Rolling wardrobes on the sides were anchored against the wind by backpacks. Scene lists were duct-taped to the tall columns on each side.\n\"I like that Abe Lincoln is looking over us,\" said Teresa Veramendi, looking up at the president's somber, seated figure. \"I think he would approve.\"\n\"Occupy My Heart: A Revolutionary Christmas Carol,\" by writer-activist William Turck, is a modern take on Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\":\nOn a cold, snowy Christmas Eve, an ambitious Chicago banker loses his job and his money-hungry girlfriend, encounters a former love who is part of the Occupy movement, is visited by three spirits who show him painful truths, and finds redemption.\n\"It really stays pretty true to the classic Dickens tale of somebody who has sold out all their values to the pursuit of money and isn't really happy,\" said Zach Johnson-Dunlop, 28, who plays the banker.\nThe action is set amid a protest, and last week it was seen by audience members who had just come from one. The premiere \u2014 a single outdoor performance Friday afternoon \u2014 was coordinated to begin at the end of a protest march that set out from LaSalle and Jackson.\nThe small and chilled crowd, joined by several perplexed tourists, watched and occasionally participated, to director Hannah Friedman's delight.\nThe actors gently shooed away a man who had walked on stage to take close-up pictures of what he thought was a real TV newscast but was actually part of the show. And one Occupy regular kept joining the actors portraying protesters in the show.\nTurck conceived of the play just before Thanksgiving. As he attended Occupy Chicago's general assemblies, he was struck by how many theater people he was meeting.\n\"I thought, 'Boy, if we could channel this talent, there's no better form of communication, heart to heart, than art,'\" he said.\nChristmas was a little more than a month away. And Turck happened to be a great fan of Dickens.\n\"On DVD somewhere, I've got just about every version of 'A Christmas Carol,'\" he said.\nTurck had his concept. He banged out the script in a week, returned to Occupy's general assembly \"and tried to convince people I was sane.\"\n\"He jumped up and said, 'I have written a play,'\" said Veramendi, 26, an actress who teaches theater in Chicago schools. \"People were very excited. \u2026 Everyone cheered.\n\n\n\"It's a great vehicle to get people interested and to bring more people into the conversation who might not come out to a protest \u2014 but who might come to a play.\"\nFriedman, 22, who has been an assistant director and stage manager at Lookingglass Theatre Company, Piven Theatre Workshop and Chicago Dramatists, saw a notice on a Chicago theater website asking for actors and a director for an Occupy play. She met with Turck and Veramendi.\n\"I got a chance to read the script, and I really liked it a lot,\" Friedman said. \"He's taken this classic \u2014 it's almost become an icon in American culture \u2014 and turned it into a revolutionary story.\"\nTurck's version differs in one important respect. \"Our banker, Josh, is a likable character. He's not Scrooge,\" he said. \"His arguments are compelling.\n\"We tried to be very realistic. We didn't want to be cartoonish. We really wanted people to think.\"\nOn Friday, actors changed costumes \u2014 all of which included coats \u2014 on stage, in the open. No one used mics, and though traffic hummed, sirens yowled and trains whistled, the actors generally made themselves heard.\nThe audience, standing behind or sitting on the steps up to the memorial, chanted along with the play's protesters and tried to stay warm. One young man passed out chemical hand warmers; another, cookies.\nAt the end, people wiggled upward-raised fingers, an Occupy expression of approval, and gave enthusiastic reviews.\n\"It was funny, but it also had real events and actions. And I liked the turnaround of the main character,\" said Ryan Griffin, who added powerful praise for an outdoor performance in winter:\n\"I was really getting cold, and I wanted to get out of here. But I really wanted to see the play.\"\n\"Occupy My Heart\" will be performed indoors, for free, at 8 p.m. Monday at the Prop Theater, 3502-04 N.

Homeless-outreach workers have checked on the camp, firefighters have looked for hazards, the finance department is handling various purchases, and the IT department set up an emergency operations center and also dealt with Web threats to the city website. Everyone in the mayor's office is involved.\nFollowing the Oct. 25 police raid, about 20 public works employees spent the day cleaning up the plaza at a cost of roughly $4,000. Public works staff said replacing the Frank Ogawa Plaza lawn alone will cost $30,000.\nCouncilman Larry Reid said that using city resources, including hundreds of police officers - with some from 16 outside agencies - to clear the camp proved to be a waste. He thinks the city should not have allowed the campers back.\n\"What was the purpose of clearing out the area for health and public safety?\" Reid said. \"We go in, we clean it out, and then we permit them to come back? For what reason?\"\nCity department heads are still assessing the costs but have remained tight-lipped about the totals. Boyd said this week that it is too early to calculate the total.\nIn an open letter to residents Tuesday, the Oakland Police Officers Association estimated that last week's events cost city taxpayers more than $1 million. Police union spokesman Dom Arotzarena said the estimate was based on what the union believes the city spent on services, including police overtime, and what the city lost in business.\nThe union letter, which criticized Mayor Jean Quan for ordering a sweep and then allowing the campers to return, said police were confused by Quan's mixed messages.\nBoyd said tallying costs is particularly complicated because of the unusual nature of the Occupy encampment and the demonstrations occupiers have spawned.\nFor earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters, Boyd said, there's an event, a city response and a recovery process. Acts of civil disobedience, on the other hand, usually last no more than a day.\nIn the case of the Occupy encampment, \"it's not an emergency in the usual way,\" Boyd said.\nWhile the costs remain unknown, the Oakl and City Council is having a special meeting tonight to discuss the idea of allowing Occupy Oakland to keep its encampment on a long-term basis at the plaza.\nThe proposal by Councilwoman Nancy Nadel, who represents downtown and West Oakland, asks city departments from police to public works to help the cause. Councilwoman Desley Brooks joined the campground for two nights and confers with its organizers.\nBut other council members are adamant the camp must go.\n\"It's absolutely unacceptable and irresponsible that we're spending all these resources in downtown ... at the expense of our neighborhoods,\" said Councilman Ignacio De La Fuente.", "metadata": {"city": "Oakland", "article_number": "5350", "filename": "5350Oakland-www.sfgate.com3-09.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-02", "state": null, "version": "31", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "www.sfgate.com3", "periodical_code": "09"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 142, "uuid": "e0a7bc37-97c1-4fe8-a93b-a6195e110c81", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 142, "uuid": "7bd0718e-5818-4459-9f45-183f0ecdb24a", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 660, "uuid": "c6000623-a890-4d24-8cbb-eb8f9453f487", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[156, 195, "Frank Ogawa Plaza in front of city hall"], [195, 320, ", continues as the Occupy Oakland protesters were forced out early this morning, along with their encampment being dismantled"], [708, 790, "on Oct. 25, clean up the place and then block campers from returning that evening."]]}, {"id": 661, "uuid": "6ff9eed2-3d56-4b2e-b510-d7ae30721390", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 2, "offsets": [[2276, 2355, "In an open letter to residents Tuesday, the Oakland Police Officers Association"], [2616, 2633, "The union letter,"]]}, {"id": 665, "uuid": "c9176ce5-654d-4169-aa97-acbe5e3ba988", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[909, 942, "Wednesday's massive demonstration"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 38, "article_number": 2190, "uri": "urn:article:2190:892368cb-d5c5-4bc4-85d9-fbba08e62ee7", "sha256": "9cda5382503f1b8188b51a71ce602ebc8855d10cc7b77b7057db0607c286ed70", "batch_name": "article", "text": "December 19, 2011 6:33 PM\n\n\nDenver\u2019s New Police Chief Puts Occupy Denver On Notice\nDENVER (CBS4) \u2013 Denver\u2019s new police chief put Occupy Denver on notice Monday \u2014 his patience has run out.\nChief Robert White met with protesters for almost an hour, telling them they need to remove their stuff from Civic Center Park or the city will.\nIt was the chief\u2019s second warning, and it is clearly his last.

Once those toxins are in our ground, they're here forever,\" Williams said.\nThe brine well, thousands of feet deep, is where a company would dispose of fluids from the oil and natural gas drilling process. ODNR said there's nearly 150,000 of these types of wells in the United States.\nWilliams said he feels enough isn't known about fracking and the fluids that eventually have to be disposed. For him, current regulations aren't tough enough.\n\"Fracking and the gas companies have had the laws changed since 2005 to benefit themselves,\" Williams said.\n\"Our government officials aren't listening to us.

As for the permit request, it's still in the hands of ODNR.\nWilliams said his opposition to fracking doesn't mean he's not for bringing new jobs to the region.\n\"We'd like to replace it with clean industry,\" Williams said.\nLink: http://www.wkbn.com/content/news/local/story/Occupy-Youngstown-Protests-At-Hubbard-Well-Site/xMkJCMdB_0mmr2p8dhmW5Q.cspx", "metadata": {"city": "Youngstown", "article_number": "8297", "filename": "8297Youngstown-CopyofCopyofCBS27-02.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-21", "state": null, "version": "31", "annotators": ["CRV", "JS"], "periodical": "CopyofCopyofCBS27", "periodical_code": "02"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 212, "uuid": "3722ceed-081b-4344-871c-003ae0f818ff", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 212, "uuid": "f6368de3-22c8-431c-967e-242e7d3cc3de", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 1036, "uuid": "7ab4494f-919a-458d-a049-112d8e655a37", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[281, 341, "well off Masury Road near Interstate 80 in Hubbard Township."], [342, 470, "That's where Occupy Youngstown members staged a protest with their message: There's too many unknowns for the project to happen."]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 129, "article_number": 4883, "uri": "urn:article:4883:fa093589-acc8-41f7-86ae-805d832468af", "sha256": "fa2e075f58e00b787d7e20464c132cd5338940f19bb93e865ad0759f3204eb3f", "batch_name": "article", "text": "29 of 392 DOCUMENTS\nContra Costa Times (California)\nOctober 25, 2011 Tuesday\nContra Costa Times editorial: Oakland police did good job in removing a public\nhealth hazard\nBYLINE: Contra Costa Times editorial \u00a9 Copyright 2011, Bay Area News Group\nSECTION: OPINION; Editorials\nLENGTH: 481 words\n\n\nThe Occupy Oakland encampment, which began on Oct. 10 and grew into a tent city\nwith 300 resident protesters, was quickly and relatively peacefully dismantled\nby police in the predawn hours on Tuesday.\nThere were a few dozen arrests and anti-police chanting, but a force of at least\n200 police had little difficulty in tearing down the camp in front of Oakland\nCity Hall along with a smaller camp near Lake Merritt. It took less than 30\nminutes to clear away the tents and campers in raids that went smoothly,\naccording to police.\nThe need to raze the camps had been obvious for days. Oakland officials reported\nrats in the camp, fights, sexual harassment, drug use and some violence against\nthe media.\nThe protesters were given adequate and explicit warning that the camps were\nillegal and needed to be dismantled and plenty of time to comply with orders to\nend the encampment.\nThere is no way the city could have allowed the camps to endure and expand\nwithout creating an increasing threat to public health and safety.\nMayor Jean Quan was correct in concluding that \"neither the demonstrators nor\nthe city could maintain safe or sanitary conditions, or control the ongoing\nvandalism.\"\nQuan also thanked the police, fire, public works and other city employees who\nworked over the last week to peacefully close the encampment, and the majority\nof the protesters who peacefully complied with city officials.\nThe swift removal of what was becoming a volatile public health menace and\npotential site of violence is good news for both the city of Oakland and for the\nprotest movement.\nHad there been a confrontation between the police and protesters that erupted\ninto violence, that would have been the focus of media attention, overshadowing\nthe message of the Occupy Oakland demonstrators.\nThe protest against widespread unemployment and corporate greed was being\ndiluted and obscured by those demonstrating for a host of other causes such as\nsupport for state prison inmates on hunger strikes, housing rights, fair wages\nand against social oppression.\nFor a protest movement to gain traction, it needs to have a clear focus and to\ngarner the support of a significant portion of the public. If what the people\nperceive is a band of disruptive, violent, unfocused demonstrators, it is likely\nthat public opinion would turn against the movement.\nThe dismantling of the camps still leaves room for the Occupy Oakland\ndemonstrators to deliver their message. Quan said the Frank H. Ogawa Plaza in\nOakland will remain open as a free-speech gathering place \"for peaceful protest\"\nfrom 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.\nIt serves no useful purpose for protesters to camp out overnight nor should\nOakland or any other city allow a potential public menace to exist. We are\nthankful that Oakland did the right thing in an efficient manner that avoided\nviolence but did not trample on anyone's rights of free speech or assembly.\nLOAD-DATE: October 26, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nGRAPHIC:\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\nCopyright 2011 Contra Costa Newspapers\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Oakland", "article_number": "4883", "filename": "4883Oakland-contracostatimescalifornia-12.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-25", "state": null, "version": "31", "annotators": ["SLG"], "periodical": "contracostatimescalifornia", "periodical_code": "12"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 129, "uuid": "b501a76c-d127-48ee-b509-67918191c0a3", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 129, "uuid": "9cd61d51-6a5a-474d-91e6-94099f1b9641", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 601, "uuid": "1cb90ea9-b1ce-4aa6-a0dd-b638d1ddf078", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[294, 347, "The Occupy Oakland encampment, which began on Oct. 10"]]}, {"id": 602, "uuid": "f0dee414-e263-41ea-af0e-f4972f69ab66", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[408, 452, "quickly and relatively peacefully dismantled"], [453, 495, "by police in the predawn hours on Tuesday."], [496, 576, "There were a few dozen arrests and anti-police chanting, but a force of at least"], [577, 654, "200 police had little difficulty in tearing down the camp in front of Oakland"], [655, 664, "City Hall"], [710, 730, "It took less than 30"], [731, 803, "minutes to clear away the tents and campers in raids that went smoothly,"], [804, 824, "according to police."]]}, {"id": 603, "uuid": "fae0314f-4057-4bef-b0d5-1aa34664831a", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 2, "offsets": [[665, 709, "along with a smaller camp near Lake Merritt."]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 37, "article_number": 2133, "uri": "urn:article:2133:23dce8ef-bc10-47a4-81a3-8cb639b21843", "sha256": "0ea9ee90f723de0e16feb526a732df010c72ebdeea4c91ce55a54d810ec4cdce", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Eight arrests at Dallas bank protest\nby MONIKA DIAZ and JONATHAN BETZ\nWFAA\nPosted on November 5, 2011 at 5:29 PM\nUpdated Saturday, Nov 5 at 11:52 PM\n\n\nDALLAS \u2014 On the day when people across the country are moving their money out of big banks, eight protesters outside a bank in Dallas were arrested.\nThe national movement is called Bank Transfer Day, a response to plans by Bank of America and other large financial institutions to add fees to debit card users.\nBut it was Occupy Dallas protesters creating the scene on Saturday, where an estimated 150 people joined in, marching from bank-to-bank in downtown Dallas.\nPolice officers were close behind, watching every move.\n\"We had the banks that we wanted to go to, and from what happened at the very beginning, Bank of America,\" said protester Perry McKnight. \"We are going to the banks we already designated, with the people.\"\nThe extra law enforcement presence followed a confrontation between police and protesters in front of the Bank of America building on Saturday afternoon.

We got sold out.\u201d\nThe crowd marched past the closed main offices of Capital One and Chase banks. Downtown Baton Rouge was largely empty, except for patrons watching the LSU-Auburn football game on the television sets in bars and restaurants.\nChemel said that large multi-national banks have set policies that hurt working people. He urged customers to close their accounts at the large financial institutions and, instead, do business with local banks and credit unions.\nCarrying signs reading, \u201cNot everyone can be CEO\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll believe corporations are people when Texas executes a corporation,\u201d the group marched past the LSU Shaw Center for the Arts to the levee by the USS Kidd Veterans Memorial & Museum. Some workers came out of their businesses to watch the procession and wave.\nThe Occupy Wall Street protests, which began in New York two months ago, have spread to cities around the world.\nIn London, a group calling itself Occupy London Stock Exchange camped outside the Cathedral of St. Paul, leading church officials to shut down the famous landmark. Also on Saturday, about 4,000 marched on the streets of Frankfurt, Germany, protesting banking policies of German financial institutions, according to news reports.\nProtesters at these events, generally, have questioned the fairness of government and corporate policies that financially help businesses that continue to lay off workers, increase prices and balk at paying more taxes.\nSimilar \u201cOccupy\u201d protests have been held in Lafayette, New Orleans and Shreveport. This was the first such event in Baton Rouge.\nBruce Blaney, of Baton Rouge, was among the 125 who gathered at the State Capitol prior to the march. He attended a similar protest on Oct. 15 by MoveOn.org. He said that while a handful of those attending the Occupy rally on Saturday were at the MoveOn event last week, most were not.\nAfter the march, the remaining members returned to the State Capitol and sat on the steps to decide their next move.\nNathan Anderson, an LSU political science major, led the discussion using Robert\u2019s Rules of Order as the group debated how to handle next Saturday\u2019s event.\nOccupy Wall Street groups around the nation want to hold simultaneous events at each of the nation\u2019s state capitols on Saturday, Oct. 29. Occupy groups from around Louisiana are planning to come to Baton Rouge, Chemel said.\nLocal organizers pointed out that the eighth annual Louisiana Book Festival takes place in and around the State Capitol at the same time.\nThe group on the steps took a vote and a majority decided to move next Saturday\u2019s event to a park near the USS Kidd, rather than disrupt the book festival, Chemel said.\nThe group also voted to allow some of their number to gather at the park around Huey Long\u2019s grave on Friday to distribute information to people attending the \u201cLive After Five\u201d concert at nearby A.Z. Young Park on Third Street, he said.\nChemel and Bryan Perkins organized Saturday\u2019s Baton Rouge protest through social media such as Facebook. Both said they are not affiliated with other \u201cOccupy\u201d groups. But members of the other groups have been contacting them, Perkins said.\nHe and Chemel met a couple of weeks of ago when they, independently, started to organize an event in Baton Rouge, Perkins said.\nChemel said he realizes Baton Rouge is a very conservative town and felt his voice was not being heard.

CNN iReporters sent in photos and video from \"occupy\" protests across several American cities.\nIn San Diego, CNN affiliate KFMB broadcast images of police detaining demonstrators as they gathered amid tents and tarps strewn about a downtown plaza.\nProtesters appeared to refuse to leave the area, sitting in columns atop the tarps and yelling, \"Stay down\" as police tried to remove them from the scene.\nIn Denver, authorities say 24 people were arrested as CNN affiliate KMGH broadcast aerial video of police detaining protesters in a downtown section of the city.\nColorado State Police patrol spokesman Mike Baker said the demonstration could be broken down into two distinct groups: The first was a part of what he described as the original \"Occupy\" group, which maintained close communication with law enforcement. The second, he said, was a more \"radical\" faction.\n\"These were the ones (police) came into trouble with today,\" Baker said.\nMost in Denver were charged for unlawful conduct on state property, he added, while one other person was charged for simple assault. Another protester was arrested for impeding traffic.\nIn New York , Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said police had arrested 14 demonstrators, after they sat down in roadways and blocked traffic, overturned trash bins, knocked over a police scooter and hurled bottles.\nWesleyan University student Ben Doernberg, who attended Friday's protest in Manhattan's financial district, shot video of at least one other demonstrator being hauled to the ground by police.\nThe video captures a police officer pressing his night stick against the back of the protester's neck during the arrest, while the man is seen faced down on the pavement.\nThe protester can be heard screaming in what Doernberg described as an earlier incident in which the man's leg was allegedly run over by a police motorcycle.\n\"I saw a number of other people being shoved or pushed with batons,\" Doernberg said. \"I saw another officer punching people.\"\nNew York police were not immediately available for comment on the allegation and CNN cannot independently verify the claim.\nLater on Friday, hip hop mogul Russell Simmons called the demonstrations \"inspirational.\"\n\"People want this country to be better,\" he told CNN. \"They want the money out of Washington,\" adding that he believed the U.S. government remains largely controlled by corporations.\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said earlier Friday that Brookfield Office Properties -- the real-estate firm that owns Zuccotti Park, considered a home-base for protesters -- made the decision not to clear them out after the company was \"inundated\" with threatening calls from elected city officials.\nThe mayor said during his weekly commentary on New York's WOR Radio that he didn't know which officials allegedly made the threats, but that the company decided to work out some form of a negotiated settlement with protesters in the coming days.\nBloomberg added that while he lacked first-hand knowledge of the conversations, he was told the officials generally threatened to \"make life more difficult\" for the real-estate company.\nBrookfield Properties issued a statement later Friday saying \"a number of local political leaders\" requested the cleaning of the park be deferred for \"a short period of time.\"\nThe cancellation averts a broader showdown between authorities and demonstrators, who appeared heartened by news of the cancellation.\n\"We are winning and Wall Street is afraid,\" protester Kira Moyer-Sims said in a written statement distributed by the group. \"This movement is gaining momentum and is too big to fail.\"\nBloomberg's office announced earlier that the real-estate firm withdrew their request made earlier in the week for police assistance during the scheduled clean-up operation.\n\"Our position has been consistent throughout: the City's role is to protect public health and safety, to enforce the law, and guarantee the rights of all New Yorkers. Brookfield believes they can work out an arrangement with the protesters that will ensure the park remains clean, safe, available for public use and that the situation is respectful of residents and businesses downtown, and we will continue to monitor the situation,\" said Deputy Mayor Cas Holloway.\nThe demonstrations have been mostly peaceful, though there had been fears of a standoff between police officers tasked with clearing the park and protesters who said they wouldn't budge.\nCity officials in New York had initially ordered the protesters to leave by 7 a.m.\nBut the demonstrators mopped, collected trash and scrubbed the pavement in the dead of the night as the Friday deadline neared for them to leave the premises for a cleanup. When the word of the postponed cleaning filtered through the more than 1,000 protesters who filled the park, they were elated.\nThe protesters, who have been chanting \"All day! All week! Occupy Wall Street,\" called the development a victory and planned to continue their passive resistance, \"We're extremely excited.This is an example of what people power can do,\" Tyler Combelic, a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street. \"This is what democracy is all about in this country,\"\nProtesters descended on the privately-owned park near the New York Stock Exchange on September 17 to protest the nation's ailing economy.\n\"You want to clean up something? Clean up these crooks on Wall Street,\" said City Council Member Charles Barron.\nCouncilwoman Letitia James of Brooklyn said the move to clean the park was a \"ruse\" to end the protest.\nBloomberg told protesters Wednesday that the decision to clean the park was made after owners voiced concerns about \"unsanitary conditions and considerable wear and tear on the park.\"\n\"The mayor is a strong believer in the First Amendment and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest,\" Holloway said in an earlier statement.\nBut the situation in the park is \"not in the best interests of the protesters, residents or the city,\" he said.\nThe plan had been to clean the park in stages, and protesters would be allowed to return to the park as areas were cleaned if they obeyed the rules set forth by the owners, Brookfield Properties, the statement said.\n\"The park has not been cleaned in four weeks, a process that is normally undertaken every night,\" Brookfield said in a statement. \"Our goal is to keep the park clean, safe, and accessible to all.\"\nZuccotti Park was built for the general public, but the weeks-long protest has raised concerns among area business owners and residents about sanitation.\nThe protest campaign began in July with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and a sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange.\nFor about a month, demonstrations have addressed such issues as police brutality, union busting and the economy, the group said.\nOrganizers have taken inspiration from this year's Arab Spring protests that swept through North Africa ad the Middle East. Crowds have taken up residence in the park in New York's financial district, and organizers have called for 20,000 people to flood the area for a \"few months.\"\n\n\nLOAD-DATE: October 15, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nNOTES: Update 1:55 p.m. adds Orlando among cities expected to have demonstrations, graf 2, highlight, adds contrib lines\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newswire\nCopyright 2011 Cable News Network\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "NewYork", "article_number": "4659", "filename": "4659NewYork-cnnwire-02.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-14", "state": null, "version": "30", "annotators": ["MB"], "periodical": "cnnwire", "periodical_code": "02"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 120, "uuid": "29bffe95-3f03-4b8f-bfb7-6b97282a00e7", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 120, "uuid": "aa908903-ded4-4ad4-82b2-d837bbced38e", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 548, "uuid": "071ca483-78ee-4299-922c-16ad0aa94847", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[1734, 1788, "Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said"]]}, {"id": 553, "uuid": "e28543c2-94c6-4c5d-8807-8a317ad7f7a0", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[232, 239, "Friday,"], [2009, 2059, "Friday's protest in Manhattan's financial district"], [5781, 5918, "Protesters descended on the privately-owned park near the New York Stock Exchange on September 17 to protest the nation's ailing economy."], [1789, 1952, "police had arrested 14 demonstrators, after they sat down in roadways and blocked traffic, overturned trash bins, knocked over a police scooter and hurled bottles."]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 103, "article_number": 4141, "uri": "urn:article:4141:1410f9de-62e6-43dd-9f31-bbb90287e021", "sha256": "dbaed9947c636e6c07c6776159d359aa31c79bbefda5851c0794cf0848ad4d5d", "batch_name": "article", "text": "5 of 8 DOCUMENTS\nThe Associated Press State & Local Wire\nOctober 16, 2011 Sunday 12:00 AM GMT\nNews from around Wisconsin at 6:58 p.m. CDT;\nSaturday, October 15, 2011\nSECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL\nLENGTH: 839 words\n\n\nMilwaukee anti-Wall Street protest draws hundreds\nMILWAUKEE (AP) Joining an internationally growing movement, hundreds of protesters marched through downtown Milwaukee on Saturday decrying corporate greed and demanding stricter regulation over the U.S.'s banking industry.\nProtesters carried signs reading, \"Tax the rich\" or \"Mr. Obama, Tear Down That Wall Street,\" and many criticized the lack of government control over banks that played a role in the nation's financial crisis.

Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs Group Inc. owns a major stake in SSA Marine and has been a frequent target of protesters.\nDemonstrators say they are standing up for workers against the port companies, which have had recent high-profile clashes with union workers. Longshoremen in Longview, for example, have had a longstanding dispute with EGT, which employs workers from a different union to staff its terminal. The longshoremen's union says the jobs rightfully belong to them.\nIn Oakland, some 1,000 protesters said they were determined to remain at the port overnight.\nWhile the protests attracted far fewer people than the 10,000 who turned out Nov. 2 to shut down Oakland's port, organizers declared victory and promised more demonstrations.\n\"Mission accomplished,\" said protest organizer Boots Riley.\nMike King, another Occupy Oakland organizer, said demonstrators had voted to remain at the port until at least 3 a.m. Tuesday to block any sudden shifts of longshoremen to offload the three ships that were neglected Monday.\n\"We had made a promise to the rest of the occupiers that if there was violence we would extend the blockade,\" said King. \"So in the spirit of solidarity, we're going to continue until tomorrow.\"\nOakland Mayor Jean Quan pleaded with the occupiers to go home and allow the longshoremen and truckers get on with their livelihoods.\n\"People have to think about the consequences,\" she said. \"People have to think about who they are hurting. They are saying, `We want to get the attention of the ruling class.' Well, I think the ruling class is probably laughing, and people in this city will be crying this Christmas. It's really got to stop.\"\nPolice in Seattle used \"flash-bang\" percussion grenades to disperse protesters who blocked an entrance to a Port of Seattle and 11 demonstrators were arrested.\nOfficers moved in Monday evening after Occupy Seattle protesters tried to set up a makeshift barrier near the entrances to two terminals, using scraps of wood and aluminum debris.\nPolice Detective Jeff Kappel said demonstrators blocked traffic and hurled flares, bags of paint and other debris at officers and police horses. He says one officer was treated by medics after a bag of paint hit his face.\nIn Portland, a couple hundred protesters blocked semitrailers from making deliveries at two major terminals.\nSecurity concerns were raised when police found two people in camouflage clothing with a gun, sword and walkie-talkies who said they were doing reconnaissance.\nIn Alaska, Occupy Anchorage protesters showed solidarity with their West Coast counterparts by focusing on port issues, though they took a different tack in Alaska's largest city.\nRather than try to shut down the port which is only open two days a week and Monday was not one of them protesters assembled to highlight what they said was mismanagement and the proposed expansion of the Port of Anchorage, which handles most goods consumed by Alaskans.\nTodd Gitlin, a sociologist at Columbia University and an authority on social movements, said the Occupy movement is highly ambitious and would continue to expand and diversify. He has said that the 1960s anti-war movement grew gradually for years until bursting onto the world stage during the election year of 1968.\n\"I would assume that the action today is going to be representative of what's going to be happening from now on,\" Gitlin said. \"There will be more of a tendency toward militant disruptive activity. There's going to be a number of coordinated actions and this is going to go on for months.\"\nSome port officials lament the loss of pay for longshoremen and truck drivers, who are not among the nation's wealthy elite and protesters would say are among the 99 percent.\n\"Today's disruptions have been costly to port workers and their families in terms of lost wages and shifts,\" Port of Oakland spokeswoman Marilyn Sandifur. She noted that the Oakland seaport is the fifth busiest container port in the United States and intended to open as usual Tuesday morning.\nGitlin said while the Occupy Wall Street movement is not as focused as the 1960s protests against the Vietnam War, it is in many ways more ambitious.\n\"The goal of the anti-war movement could be agreed upon by everyone who took part in it,\" he said. \"There was a convergence. This is a long and deep process to fight against the power of the wealthy. That was a huge social convulsion that involved millions of people; this present movement has that potential, but it will be a long time before we know how far it goes.\"\nSome longshoremen supported the Occupy Oakland protesters, even though they lost a day's wages. But some of the truck drivers who had to wait in long lines as protesters blocked gates said the demonstrators were harming the very people they were trying to help.\n\"This is joke. What are they protesting?\" said Christian Vega, who sat in his truck carrying a load of recycled paper. He said the delay was costing him $600. \"It only hurts me and the other drivers.\n\"We have jobs and families to support and feed,\" he said. \"Most of them don't.\"\nAssociated Press writers Beth Duff-Brown in San Francisco, Christina Hoag in Long Beach, Calif., Nigel Duara in Portland, Ore., Manuel Valdes and Doug Esser in Seattle and Dan Joling in Anchorage, Alaska, contributed to this report.\n\n\nLOAD-DATE: December 14, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newswire\nCopyright 2011 Associated Press\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Anchorage", "article_number": "259", "filename": "259Anchorage-associatedpressonline-04.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-13", "state": null, "version": "24", "annotators": ["EDC", "CRV"], "periodical": "associatedpressonline", "periodical_code": "04"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 54, "uuid": "f7df39dc-0380-4d57-a8ff-a9cad0873bdd", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 54, "uuid": "a67b7728-349f-404f-b766-67d4b5e3e839", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 235, "uuid": "77b64791-fccf-4dbb-86c5-1877f1429636", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[4035, 4041, "Monday"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 77, "article_number": 3468, "uri": "urn:article:3468:94ec4b0d-0cb4-45a1-8fd5-19bb9f3aeb2d", "sha256": "570d1882288c796f1d4e789e6b06a38d5f6670c7de1542ae5cf4a9df6d822483", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Occupy Long Beach, cops keep peace\nLincoln Park protesters pick up tents nightly to follow city rules\nBy Eric Bradley and Tracy Manzer\nStaff Writers\nPosted:   10/25/2011 09:57:40 PM PDT\nUpdated:   10/25/2011 10:53:16 PM PDT\n\n\nA Long Beach police officer patrols the Occupy Long Beach camp at Lincoln Park in Long Beach, Calif. on October 25, 2011. (Jeff Gritchen / Staff Photographer)\n\n\nLONG BEACH - As police in Oakland cleared a camp of Occupy protesters Tuesday, participants in Long Beach's offshoot of the anti-Wall Street movement operated in a detente with law enforcement at Lincoln Park.\nSpeaking against what they called the \"tyranny\" of large banks and corporations, Occupy Long Beach has settled into a pattern of small, lounging protests by day, gathering after business hours in larger numbers and, for the die-hard adherents to the group, striking their tents and moving to the sidewalk after 10 p.m.\nThe ongoing schedule agreement was reached through consultation between police and leaders of the now 11-day-old occupation of the park next to City Hall at 333 W. Ocean Blvd.\nLong Beach Deputy Police Chief Robert Luna said the policy itself was created after study of the city's ordinance that bars camping in parks and public spaces.\nHe defined the ensuing rules as firm but respectful in regard to what protesters can and cannot do.\n\"Our goal is to allow them to exercise their First Amendment rights without being in violation of the city ordinance,\" Luna said.\nThough protesters can slumber at night, there's no real sleep for the weary at Lincoln Park in the eyes of the law.\n\"They can rest for a while, but they have to wake up and walk around periodically,\" Luna said.\nProtesters this week credited police for working with them, but complained about the floodlights that have been used at night to illuminate the park.\nAmong their demands of government was a call for restoring regulations governing corporations that have been cut over the last few decades.\n\"A corporation is unaccountable to people,\" said Jonathan Allen, 26, of Seal Beach.\nSmall businesses and banks can't compete against conglomerates such as Wal-Mart and Bank of America in the present era of deregulation, he argued.\n\"The analogy is a pro-football player geared up, ready to tackle an elementary school football player,\" Allen said.\nA 27-year-old woman who identified herself as Sunrise pointed to vacant office space around Lincoln Park and said she shows up out of a desire to rebuild the community.\n\"I believe you can't change the world unless you change the community you live in first,\" she said.\nBesides attracting attention to its cause, Occupy Long Beach, like other chapters nationwide, has also attracted part of downtown's homeless population.\n\"They're flocking to us for the free food,\" said Allen.\nSome homeless participate in the protests or hold signs, while others squabble with protesters for what they view as their \"territory,\" according to Allen.\n\"They need to realize they're part of the 99 percent,\" Allen said, adding that organizers are considering a move to another city park.\nCriminal incidents at Lincoln Park have been sporadic, officials said.\nThe few protesters who have been arrested for camping in the park after 10 p.m. were given verbal warnings and blatantly violated the regulations agreed upon by officers and Occupy Long Beach representatives, police said.\nSunday night, after police experimented with turning off the floodlights at night, two protesters were arrested for domestic violence, and a homeless couple fought over a cellphone and were arrested for allegedly making terrorist threats, Luna said.\nLuna was grateful for the relative peace in Long Beach, considering other cities have experienced less cooperative, more civilly disobedient protesters.\n\"We've had some problems with a few individuals getting into officers' faces and trying to force confrontations, but the vast majority have been respectful and so have the officers,\" Luna said.\neric.bradley@presstelegram.com, 562-499-1254\ntracy.manzer@presstelegram.com, 562-499-1261\nFollow Eric Bradley on Twitter at http://twitter.com/EricBradleyPT", "metadata": {"city": "LongBeach", "article_number": "3468", "filename": "3468LongBeach-PressTelegram-03.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-25", "state": null, "version": "28", "annotators": ["EDC"], "periodical": "PressTelegram", "periodical_code": "03"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 77, "uuid": "9d7ae021-bcf6-48a1-9ad0-110581207f43", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 77, "uuid": "4537ed4e-6fdf-4997-97e6-40b20a98ce34", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 334, "uuid": "69149fe7-0cba-48a6-a6b8-fce97c8d0f63", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[1092, 1139, "Long Beach Deputy Police Chief Robert Luna said"], [3631, 3641, "Luna said."]]}, {"id": 340, "uuid": "a5d92250-f597-475b-94fc-c76995b6d98e", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[916, 1091, "The ongoing schedule agreement was reached through consultation between police and leaders of the now 11-day-old occupation of the park next to City Hall at 333 W.

They use the excuse that there won't be jobs if we tax the rich.

He sees Occupy Tampa as a solid movement that, especially in the wake of dozens of arrests over the last two months, has lacked a true public space to spread its message.\n\"The fact is they don't have a park,\" Skinner says. \"Their resilience here is amazing.\"\nThat's why even though Voice of Freedom Park isn't truly being occupied - it's more of a community gathering space for the movement - it still helps Occupy Tampa greatly. They can use it to help the community while figuring out what direction their movement goes next.\n\"Now we're kind of at the stage where we have to really buckle down, decide what we're about, and start accomplishing things,\" Morris says.\nAnd they're happy to have Redner's support behind them.\n\"What we need to do is get this country on the right footing by taxing the people that can afford to pay the tax and helping the people that don't have the jobs,\" Redner says.\nLink: http://www.wtsp.com/news/article/226891/8/Mons-Venus-owner-lends-park-to-Occupy-Tampa", "metadata": {"city": "Tampa", "article_number": "7721", "filename": "7721Tampa-CBS10-04.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-18", "state": null, "version": "30", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "CBS10", "periodical_code": "04"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 199, "uuid": "fdc81dbb-4a5f-4c01-9927-037b7184902c", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 199, "uuid": "8d0d238e-672b-43f4-8125-102e30128fc1", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 987, "uuid": "a6432fdb-4b2e-4f85-8e5a-2efbedb10062", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[690, 766, "On Saturday, Occupy Tampa set up for the first time in Voice of Freedom Park"], [766, 874, ", offering food and clothing donations to the surrounding neighborhood in collaboration with Food Not Bombs."]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 96, "article_number": 4006, "uri": "urn:article:4006:e0d475de-1fd3-47f0-83ef-65ea4519c68f", "sha256": "30802f42c8fa3b9e9c812c85769504df5390f39cf5038cadb9045d659508095c", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Occupy Wall Street Movement Spawns Louisville Protest\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -\nThe Occupy Wall Street movement, now in its 18th day in New York City, is expanding.\nThe protests are showing up Boston, Los Angeles and even in Louisville.\nOccupy Louisville said their act of civil disobedience will go on indefinitely until they get legislation to eliminate corporate influence on the federal government.\nClick Like For Louisville News Updates:\nNearly 100 protesters gathered in the downtown business district Tuesday because they're not pleased with the federal government.\nOccupy Louisville isn't targeting any specific businesses, but their mission is in line with Occupy Wall Street's.\n\"We share their vision.

Although he is a photographer and more likely to wear jeans on the job, he put on a coat and tie.\nLater that evening he was wearing handcuffs.\nGraham works for RVA Magazine, an alternative entertainment and arts publication in Richmond. That night, he had a free-lance gig to photograph a Halloween party at a trendy Richmond nightclub.\nAround 1 a.m., when the typical Halloween bash is at its scariest, he got a phone call from Preston Duncan, the publisher of RVA Magazine. The police were moving on the Occupy Richmond site. Let's get over there and cover it, Duncan said.\nThe two men went to Kanawha Plaza in downtown Richmond, a public square that was full of hand-lettered protest signs and a scruffy crowd of people who had been camping there for weeks.\nLike so many protesters in different cities who sought to follow the example of the \"Occupy Wall Street\" organizers, they railed, somewhat indiscriminately, against \"greed\" or corporate anything.\nIn an account published at rvamag.com, Duncan wrote that while he and Graham were standing on the public sidewalk on the perimeter of the plaza, they were threatened with arrest by the police. They moved to the area designated for journalists. But the view from that corner was obscured.\nGraham walked to the middle of a crosswalk to get a better angle. He was arrested for trespassing and handcuffed. There were other people on both sides of the crosswalk, Graham wrote in the same account.\n\"But none of them had cameras,\" he added.\nGraham was charged under Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-119, a section called \"Trespass after having been forbidden to do so.\" It is a Class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to 12 months in jail and a $2,500 fine.\nGraham told me that he was supposed to have a hearing on Nov. 18; he and his lawyer, Patrick Anderson, expected the charges to be dropped. But the Richmond commonwealth's attorney's office for some reason is playing hardball, so Anderson got a continuance.\nAnderson, who has been retained by the American Civil Liberties Union to represent Graham, said he couldn't comment except to confirm that the matter is set for trial on Jan. 24. The Richmond commonwealth's attorney's office wasn't talking either; they didn't return my call by press time.\nGraham's case is one of eight instances across the country in which journalists have been arrested while seeking to cover police activity relating to Occupy protests. That's a distinction the City of Richmond, and the Commonwealth of Virginia, should not be proud of.\nJournalist groups in the commonwealth have lodged protests with police and prosecutors over Graham's arrest; there is even a Facebook group called \"Free Ian Graham.\"\nThe Virginia Code provides a strong statement of public policy about how journalists should be treated when covering news events. It's about police lines, but you will get the idea. Code \u00a7 15.2-1714 allows \"personnel from information services such as press, radio and television\" to cross a police line \"when gathering news,\" so long as they don't obstruct the police in their work. In other words, as a question of policy, journalists with cameras get to go where others can't, when they are covering news events.\nAccording to Mickey H. Osterreicher, general counsel for the National Press Photographers Association, very few other states provide such statutory protection to the news media. Virginia's statute is strong and could serve as a model for other states, he said.\nWhat exactly is Graham accused of? Here is the pertinent language of Code \u00a7 18.2-119: \"If any person without authority of law goes upon or remains upon the lands, buildings or premises of another ... after having been forbidden to do so ... by the owner, lessee, custodian, or the agent of any such person, or other person lawfully in charge thereof ... he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\"\nThis statute is used by landlords to get rid of deadbeat tenants, by merchants to prevent suspected shoplifters from coming into a store and by public housing projects to keep away undesirables. Ian Graham, armed with his camera and doing his job as a photojournalist, doesn't fit that list.\nThere are so many ifs to a prosecution under this statute: If Graham was there \"without authority of law.\" If the officers issued a proper warning, \"forbidding\" Graham from any locale. If the cops were the custodians or \"lawfully in charge\" of the street. If this statute even applies.\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia has interpreted Code \u00a7 18.2-119 and predecessor statutes in a number of cases. In 1929, the court held that the trespass law does not apply to \"thoroughfares,\" a position it has reiterated repeatedly. A 1990 Virginia Court of Appeals opinion defined thoroughfares: \"those ways or passages designated for public access.\" Sounds like a crosswalk to me.\nWhy hasn't this case been dropped? Why has Graham been forced to lawyer up and sweat out a possible jail term?\nThere's hardball, and then there is the pursuit of unwarranted criminal charges that aren't supported by the facts or the law. Call that what it is: governmental intimidation and an abuse of an individual's basic rights.\nFree Ian Graham?\nHell, yes. Free us all.\n\n\nLOAD-DATE: December 29, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: Opinion\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\nCopyright 2011 Dolan Media Newswires\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Richmond", "article_number": "6368", "filename": "6368Richmond-virginialawyersweekly-08.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-22", "state": null, "version": null, "annotators": ["DUPLICATE"], "periodical": "virginialawyersweekly", "periodical_code": "08"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 162, "uuid": "17bf3aa1-3ad2-4b18-b366-8322136b4c94", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 162, "uuid": "337a946a-db9c-4058-8964-0ea973303724", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 777, "uuid": "c1c369c3-22f8-440b-b730-1cd72af20625", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[1468, 1671, "Graham walked to the middle of a crosswalk to get a better angle.

A-20\nLENGTH: 328 words\n\n\nThe protesters gathered across from the state Capitol early Friday had a frequent refrain: \"Freedom doesn't have a curfew,\" they chanted.\nBut when the right of the people to assemble and protest comes crashing into the authority of a government to set the rules for public property - as it did in Lincoln Park late Thursday and early Friday, when police moved to evict the protesters - the law leaves little to doubt.\n\"Obviously protesters have the right to use public forums like parks, but it's not an unlimited right,\" said University of Denver law professor Alan Chen. \"The Supreme Court has held quite clearly that government is able to regulate speech in what are called time, place and manner regulations.\"\nThat means, on state property, the state government can effectively create regular business hours. If the park is \"closed,\" the protesters have a much harder task arguing that it is illegal to remove them.\nThe nearly 30-year-old case that established the law is strikingly similar to the Occupy Denver protest. In Clark vs. Community for Creative Non-Violence, the Supreme Court decided that a rule that prohibited camping in a park near the White House - and prevented protesters from sleeping in the park overnight - was reasonable because the government had an interest in keeping the park from getting trashed.\nThe key, Chen said, is the regulation must be consistent and apply to everyone, not just certain groups of protesters. That is where state and Denver officials might find themselves in a spot of legal bother, Chen said.\nBecause the state closed the park indefinitely after removing the protesters, the activists might have an opening to argue that their rights were violated because the government shut down their forum altogether.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado also raised that question, calling on Gov. John Hickenlooper to reopen the park to protesters by 5 a.m. Sunday. The governor has not said when his order will be lifted.\n\n\nLOAD-DATE: October 16, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\nCopyright 2011 The Denver Post\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Denver", "article_number": "2254", "filename": "2254Denver-thedenverpost-01.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-15", "state": null, "version": "31", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "thedenverpost", "periodical_code": "01"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 39, "uuid": "e2c0acf1-a349-4096-9a3a-84e8077f3fe6", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 39, "uuid": "50f62d5e-57bd-4673-8c6d-d587db900f63", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 182, "uuid": "a88be6c3-2c6f-45f3-a47d-73e3b4f3feed", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[504, 516, "Lincoln Park"], [517, 590, "late Thursday and early Friday, when police moved to evict the protesters"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 83, "article_number": 3599, "uri": "urn:article:3599:952378b8-a22d-499d-9bc4-7b4f73cba0bf", "sha256": "790fceabbb7dd2a756a584fa991401b3d186eab153e682f1eabb8c9f807122d7", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Occupy L.A.: More than 200 arrested in peaceful sweep\nNovember 30, 2011 |  5:47 am\n\n\nWithout resorting to large-scale violence, Los Angeles police successfully cleared out the Occupy L.A. camp at City Hall early Wednesday, managing to avoid fierce confrontations that marred sweeps in Oakland and New York.\nHundreds of police officers swarmed the large camp at City Hall\u2019s south lawn shortly after midnight, encircling the demonstrators in less than 10 minutes. By quickly establishing a perimeter, police managed to take control of the scene in the first moments of engagement.\nNo tear gas was used in the shutdown of what was the nation's largest remaining Occupy camp. More than 200 people were arrested in the operation that involved 1,400 officers.\n \u201cThey were like storm troopers. They encircled us,\u201d said protester Cheryl Aichele, who was sitting in the middle of the south lawn in a circle with other protesters when police first entered the camp.\nThe protesters largely kept to their promise of confronting the police peacefully. While some taunted police verbally and a few rocks were thrown, most protesters either left on their own or nonviolently submitted to arrest, with many going limp and forcing the police to carry them out.\n Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck was satisfied in the first few moments after the raid.\n\u201cThat was the hardest part,\u201d Beck said of the first rush of officers into the park. \u201cThat first contact: You learn if your officers are going to break ranks and if people are going to get physical. It went as well as we could have expected.\u201d\nIn a matter of minutes, officers poured out of City Hall and from streets in all directions, encircling the park as protesters linked arms and chanted, \"We are peaceful\" and \"We are the 99%.\"\nIt was a stark departure from old LAPD crowd control techniques, Beck said. In years past, police would have used a single skirmish line to sweep through the park and push people out.\nMayor Antonio Villaraigosa appeared proud and relieved after the eviction, and thanked officers in a brief predawn news conference.\n\u201cI said that here in L.A., we\u2019d chart a different path. And we did,\u201d Villaraigosa said.\nSpeaking with the mayor, Beck said he had established a relationship with the protesters early on in the seven-week demonstration.\nMost protesters seemed to eschew violence, and downtown did not see any of the violence of the kind that erupted in Oakland last month, when protesters started fires, police used tear gas and some protesters suffered serious injuries.\nBy early Wednesday, the last remaining protesters had holed up in a palm tree just outside Villaraigosa's office. The protesters smoked cigars as they joked with police, at one point asking police to bring them beer.\nThe moment spoke to the generally light tone of the eviction. Moments before police entered the park, protesters were setting off fireworks. After they entered, a man who refused to leave told an officer: \"If you give me a hug, I will leave right now.\"\n\"Are you serious?\" the officer asked with a smile. He appeared for a moment ready to comply, but then moved away.\nStill, there were some moments of tension. A confrontation built early in the evening on the corner of 1st Street and Broadway, where a crowd approaching from the west, seeking to join protesters at City Hall, was stopped by a line of police wearing face masks and armed with batons.\nOn Main Street, one protester yelled at police: \"Remember your mother! You're not here to beat up citizens.\"\nTwenty-eight-year-old Sam Gray, an Army veteran, said he is angry that the city \"took its word back.\"\n\"I took an oath to uphold the Constitution and in my opinion, the police are trampling on it,\" he said.\nToward the end of the operation, a large group of protesters that had locked arms in the middle of the south lawn chanted to police making arrests: \u201cYou\u2019re sexy. You\u2019re cute. Take off your riot suit.\u201d\nEarlier in the night, at the police staging area outside Dodger Stadium, a supervisor told a group of officers that they needed to be prepared for some protesters to fight back.\n\"They've got a bunch of concrete gravel and other things they're going to throw at us,\" he said. \"Please put your face masks down and watch each other's back.\"\nAmid fears protesters had stored urine and feces to throw at officers, some were wearing white protective body suits.\nThe conclusion of the raid marked the end of a two-month tent city that the City Council initially welcomed, with then-Council President Eric Garcetti telling protesters they could \"stay as long as you need.\"\nBut city leaders began withdrawing their support as the demonstrators seemed determined to stay indefinitely.\nBy 5 a.m., the protest site was in shambles, and what was left of the tents was strewn across the ground.", "metadata": {"city": "LosAngeles", "article_number": "3599", "filename": "3599LosAngeles-LATimes-05.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-30", "state": null, "version": "29", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "LATimes", "periodical_code": "05"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 83, "uuid": "143415de-b8aa-4050-b5e5-1ebfa3798c2a", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 83, "uuid": "bebf0539-68f3-469d-b620-0ff6b36cecea", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 365, "uuid": "e0aebef8-4545-48ef-9e11-b706ee5768e6", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[128, 221, "Los Angeles police successfully cleared out the Occupy L.A. camp at City Hall early Wednesday"], [307, 342, "Hundreds of police officers swarmed"], [384, 460, "shortly after midnight, encircling the demonstrators in less than 10 minutes"], [672, 706, "More than 200 people were arrested"], [738, 753, "1,400 officers."], [1045, 1243, "some taunted police verbally and a few rocks were thrown, most protesters either left on their own or nonviolently submitted to arrest, with many going limp and forcing the police to carry them out."], [3758, 3925, "a large group of protesters that had locked arms in the middle of the south lawn chanted to police making arrests: \u201cYou\u2019re sexy.

However, the OccupyMN Facebook page said that the police were going to take down the tents soon.\nIn a press release Friday, authorities said that if they saw protesters putting up a tent, they would ask them to stop.

Police said that the protestors are unofficially allowed to stay at that location.\n\"I slept there last night with, I counted, about 100 fellow occupiers,\" said Occupy Miami member Misael Soto.\n\"To me, literally occupying is the greatest display of solidarity for the cause I can show ,\" Soto said as to why he camped out Saturday night. \" It's what the movement is all about. Protesting 24/7, taking back our government and economy.\"\nOther members of Occupy Miami expressed their concerns, and explained why they plan to keep protesting.\n\"I'm upset about money and politics, it's a big one,\" said group member Seth Crouser. \"I'm  personally upset about the financial collapse and how that happened and how there's been no culpability.\"\n\"What we're doing right now is kind of an experience with democracy,\" Occupy Miami member Mike Park said. \"And it's giving us an idea of what can be done with masses.\"\nThe group had gathered on Saturday, as hundreds of protestors gathered along Biscayne Boulevard, chanting and holding up signs showing their frustration and anger at corporate America, the federal government and the banking system.\nThey marched several blocks to Government Center where they continued their demonstration. Drivers honked to show their support as protestors stood outside.\nPeople chanted and held up signs. One sign read: \"Banks Were Bailed Out You Were Sold Out\" and another read \"Healthcare Not Warfare.\" Meanwhile, the Herald reported that police said the number of protestors had been more than 1,000.\nPeople continued discussing the protest on Occupy Miami's Facebook page throughout the weekend. Protestors also gathered in Fort Lauderdale on Sunday in the Bubier park area to show their continued support of the Occupy movement.\n\"Hey everyone!\" Occupy Fort Lauderdale posted on their Facebook page. \"It's a beautiful day to make our presence known in FTL! Come on down to the Bubier park area and help us make it known that we aren't going anywhere.\"\nMeanwhile, in Chicago, the early morning arrests of 175 members of a group demonstrating against corporate greed signified a new phase of civil disobedience for the city's wing of the movement, organizers said Sunday.\nThe arrests came after hundreds of members of Occupy Chicago refused to take down tents and leave Grant Park near the city's lakefront when it closed at 11 p.m. Saturday. Organizers did not seek a permit to be in the park after hours, saying they stayed because they need a home base for the growing movement.\nOn Saturday, Occupy protestors gathered all over the world. Violence broke out in Rome, where police fired tear gas and water cannons at some protestors who broke away from the main demonstration, smashing shop and bank windows, torching cars and hurtling bottles. Dozens were injured. And tens of thousands marched in cities across Europe, as the protests that began in New York linked up with long-running demonstration against government cost-cutting and failed financial policies in Europe. Protestors also turned out in Australia and Asia.\nThe Occupy Wall Street demonstration started out small last month, with less than a dozen college students spending days and nights in Zucotti Park, a private plaza off Broadway. It has grown significantly, however, both in New York City and elsewhere as people in other communities display their solidarity in similar protests.", "metadata": {"city": "Miami", "article_number": "4103", "filename": "4103Miami-NBCMiami-05.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-16", "state": null, "version": "29", "annotators": ["SLG"], "periodical": "NBCMiami", "periodical_code": "05"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 100, "uuid": "c3bb8436-0cab-41ea-b176-5ec7001a82c6", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 100, "uuid": "d0ee87a3-facb-4f45-86f1-1a223cc2e2c4", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 444, "uuid": "04975478-9c00-4950-85d5-e2849360c40b", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[1388, 1484, "The group had gathered on Saturday, as hundreds of protestors gathered along Biscayne Boulevard,"], [1620, 1710, "They marched several blocks to Government Center where they continued their demonstration."], [1711, 1776, "Drivers honked to show their support as protestors stood outside."], [1963, 2009, "number of protestors had been more than 1,000."]]}, {"id": 445, "uuid": "1be81578-0b7c-4889-b434-8cc1db85303e", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 2, "offsets": [[1651, 1710, "Government Center where they continued their demonstration."]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 150, "article_number": 55, "uri": "urn:article:55:24d4b24f-d5f9-4786-91a7-92fe1c327535", "sha256": "834a5d1d20b2d423f40341364f51b5a8b173ae87c7c17ff6d320dbf6de3bddbf", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Occupy gets OK to stay for now\nCity to give Albany protesters 15-day permit to stay in park\nBy BRYAN FITZGERALD, Staff writer\nUpdated 8:04 am, Thursday, December 8, 2011\n\n\nALBANY \u2014 Occupy Albany has a home in Academy Park for at least the next 15 days.\nAfter a weekend-long cleanup and consolidation of their makeshift municipality\n\nand two meetings with city officials, the protesters learned Wednesday morning that they will be issued a permit allowing them to maintain a 24-hour presence in the city-owned park between City Hall and the Capitol until Dec. 22.\nThe city had given Occupy Albany until Tuesday to correct 15 code violations found at the then 80-tent encampment during a surprise inspection Friday. Though three minor violations were found when code inspectors combed throughout the site Tuesday, Occupy Albany members promised Wednesday to amend those problems quickly. The permit was issued hours after the group's 10:30 a.m. meeting with city officials.\nThe demonstrators maintain the permit, which required them to downsize their site, is not a concession but a means of biding time as the group plots its next move. \"It was something the city asked us to do and we thought it was in our best interest to maintain with them the good relationship we've established with them,\" said Hezzie Johanson, a member of Occupy Albany's public relation arm who was part of Wednesday's meeting with the city.\nThe agreement is the latest chapter in a cordial coexistence between the city and the demonstrators that has played out since the protest began Oct. 21. While other cities have commanded police to remove protesters from Occupy sites across the country, sparking clashes between cops and demonstrators marked by explosive images of protesters on the receiving end of cans of pepper spray and batons.\nBut the lengthy detente between the two sides in Albany now seems as though it may have an end date of Dec. 22. Occupy Albany remains adamant it needs to maintain a 24-hour presence in the park, and the city, fearing health risks that come from camping all night in the bitter cold, maintains it will not let protesters slumber on its land come winter.\n\"We all agree we're not on the same page,\" said Mark Mishler, a lawyer for Occupy Albany who has sat in on the group's meetings with the city. \"Our expectation is that people will be staying in Academy Park past Dec. 22.\"\nCity officials would not speculate Wednesday on what would happen if protesters still had their tents staked in the park come the first day of winter, but Mishler said the city has indicated it has no intention of forcibly removing the demonstrators.\n\"It's hard to imagine any municipal official looking at Oakland, Philadelphia, or Los Angeles and thinking that makes any sense at all,\" Mishler said, referring to cities that have seen efforts by police to remove protesters turn turbulent. \"How can you look at that and think that makes sense? My impression is the city is looking at those things and they know it's wrong, dangerous, and completely unnecessary.\"\nAssistant Corporation Counsel Jeffery Jamison, who also serves as the city's director of building and codes, suggested any dispute over Occupy Albany's right to stay in the park 24 hours a day after Dec. 22 \u2014 the group will be free to protest on city land during the day \u2014 may end up in court. \"That option is always there for either party,\" he said.\nWith the backing of Albany County District Attorney David Soares, the protesters were successful in their first round of court appearances last month. That's when Soares' office, against the desire of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, moved to dismiss all charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct against more than 100 protesters arrested over eight nights by State Police for crossing into the adjacent state-owned Lafayette Park after its 11 p.m. curfew.\nMishler said that peaceful cooperation between both sides is a direct result of factors that brought Soares and Albany Police Chief Steve Krokoff into office. Soares was ushered into office in 2004 thanks in part to a tremendous amount of grassroots support; Krokoff was chosen as chief with the backing of the Albany Common Council.\n\"With past administrations, I do not think things may have played out for us the way they did,\" Mishler said. \" There's a certain level of commitment to the community from (Soares and Krokoff) that is making the success of Occupy Albany unique.\"\nOccupy Albany members, however, maintain their movement will not be as effective if they do not have a 24-hour presence. The group said they and Occupy movements around the state had a direct influence on a bipartisan tax plan unveiled Tuesday that cuts taxes for those earning between $40,000 and $300,000. \"We would like to take a lot of credit for that,\" said Johanson.\nAt the behest of the city, the protesters scaled down their encampment to meet the permit requirements. Among other regulations of the permit, Occupy Albany is now limited to 30 tents, cannot have open flames or cooking equipment and is limited to two heaters and one generator that must be attended to at all times, though the encampment had none of the latter items at the park Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\nReach Bryan Fitzgerald at 454-5414 or bfitzgerald@timesunion.com.

The Occupy movement asked supporters to close their bank accounts at commercial banks and open accounts at community-based banks and credit unions.\n\"We can't let the fox watch the henhouse anymore,\" activist Susan Wilkinson said. \"They don't self-police and they don't behave responsibly.\"\nA number of supporters went into the downtown Seattle Chase bank to close their accounts. The group marched in a peaceful and orderly way. Police were present and officers did not need to intercede with the group.\nMany of the protesters who transferred banks as part of the event knew for a long time beforehand that they would be making a change, but needed the motivation.\n\"I didn't have the energy to change and go through all of the paperwork, but as I started becoming more politically aware, I got the energy,\" Wilkinson said.\nA large part of the Occupy movement has focused its criticism on large banks that many supporters believe are responsible for the current downturn. Citing the bank's \"corporate greed\" and role in the uptick in home foreclosures that have occurred over the course of the past few years, Occupy supporters believe that physically moving their monetary assets will send a message to the banks.\nThe message they are sending to banks is succinct: \"It's not me, it's you,\" Amelia Vasser said. She took part because of the national movement.\n\"I've seen them chargee me ridiculous fees, re-arrange transactions so they could charge me the most amount in overdraft things,\" Vasser said. \"I have no complaint with my branch, the complaint is with corporate arrogance, the complaint is with corporate Chase.\"\nOn their website, Occupy Seattle posted that the group \u201cbelieves that we need to support financial institutions, like local banks and credit unions, that invest in our communities, make loans to small businesses, and help create jobs.

Hartman\u2019s children, on the other hand, marched in the Occupy Wall Street rally in New York.\n\u201cThere was no way I was going to miss the one in Frederick,\u201d said Hartman who carried a sign stating \u201cCapitalism with Compassion.\u201d\n\u201cI want the war to end. I want money being spent here in America for jobs,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anarchy and I don\u2019t want communism,\u201d she added. \u201cI want capitalism with compassion.\u201d\nThe American Dream Movement endorses 10 steps to revive the American Dream. Among other steps, the movement urges politicians to stop the war, invest in American infrastructure, outlaw corporate tax breaks and invest in public education and creating 21st century energy jobs.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine any American being against that,\u201d Hartman said.\nFrederick resident Art Silverman agreed and said he took his 8-year-old son Charlie out of school just so he could participate in the protest.\n\u201cI took him out of school for a lesson in democracy,\u201d Silverman said.\n\u201cWe want to let people know that the Tea Party doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on patriotism in Frederick,\u201d he added.\nThe Frederick protest was one of more than 300 events taking place around the country as part of American Dream Movement\u2019s \u201cJobs Not Cuts\u201d week of action, which started on Monday.\n\u201cWe are a huge movement,\u201d said Jeannette Bartelt, a 64-year-old Frederick resident and the Frederick MoveOn coordinator who organized the Frederick rally.\nFounded in 1998, MoveOn is an American nonprofit progressive public policy advocacy group and political action committee. The group started as an email group and today allows members to promote local civil action and organize protests.\nThough the rally was focused on national issues, Bartelt said she hopes it would be an opportunity to address politicians \u2014 such as U.S. Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett (R - Dist. 6) of Buckeystown to Frederick Board of County Commissioners President Blaine R. Young (R) \u2014 and confront them about cutting jobs.\nBartelt said she was very pleased with the turnout at the event on Wednesday, especially because the weather was bad and it took place in the middle of the work week.\n\u201cPeople are hurting,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is really a people\u2019s movement.\u201d\nSusan Beam, another Frederick resident who joined the protest agreed with that. Beam, who is self-employed and used to paint homes, said the bad economy has deprived her of the opportunity to take care of herself. So she said she wants to see politicians stop investing in the war and put money into job creation inside the U.S.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want welfare, I just want a job,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to support myself.\u201d\nmraycheva@gazette.net\nhttp://www.gazette.net/article/20111012/NEWS/710129301/1009/protesters-use-downtown-frederick-as-platform-to-save-the-american&template=gazette", "metadata": {"city": "Frederick", "article_number": "2794", "filename": "2794Frederick-Gazette.Net-01.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-12", "state": null, "version": "28", "annotators": ["MB"], "periodical": "Gazette.Net", "periodical_code": "01"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 60, "uuid": "c8922a01-9c49-419b-b444-a30a86b9e982", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 60, "uuid": "b9071ef2-56f0-4480-b519-4ad85052b885", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 268, "uuid": "b6e7b271-f0bd-4be4-b4bc-ff9de6897573", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[210, 370, "Armed with posters, slogans and umbrellas, more than 40 protesters on Wednesday gathered at the intersection of Market and Patrick streets in downtown Frederick"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 112, "article_number": 4324, "uri": "urn:article:4324:041acd33-78ca-4c4f-a944-31cbef978b9b", "sha256": "5986f3f08a2786748597df29d691f82a1d64856db97ec9c9b80d1bf1148c241d", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Occupy Missoula: Small part of important movement\nOctober 28, 2011 9:15 am\n                                                                                                                 \n                                                                \nKelly Maier (letter, Oct. 21) writes of the \"ridiculous insanity playing out on the lawn of the courthouse\" and asks, \"Why do a few have so much power of self expression?\"\nThis \"ridiculous insanity,\" Occupy Missoula, is a small but important part of a nationwide movement asking a better question: Why do we accept that so few have so much wealth and power that they control our government?\nExamples?

Passing trucks occasionally honked their horns, and a few that tried to enter the terminal were let through.\nProtesters said the trucks allowed to pass were not serving one of the organizations targeted by the demonstration.\nGov. John Kitzhaber said almost 5,000 Oregon companies depend on exports and employ thousands of people who are part of the so-called 99 percent that the Occupy Wall Street protests purport to represent.\n\"In trying to force a public debate and I cheer the public debate, I think it's important I think the movement does some damage to the people that it's ostensibly trying to\" help, Kitzhaber told reporters at a gathering of business and political leaders in Portland.\nThe protest took on a carnival atmosphere after participants decided police weren't a threat. Three people juggled oranges, a man gyrated within a hula-hoop, and an accordionist accompanied by a man beating an empty plastic bucket kept up a steady patter.\nProtesters set their sights on two West Coast companies port operator SSA Marine and grain exporter EGT.\nGiant investment firm Goldman Sachs owns a major stake in SSA Marine and has been a frequent target of protesters.\nRobert Walker, 19, said he was unsure where the protest was heading.\n\"That's the power of this whole thing, that it's spontaneous,\" he said.\nOfficers making a traffic stop found the gun with ammunition clips and other items in a car carrying two men who said they were an advance team for the demonstration, police Lt. Robert King said. A 26-year-old man was driving with a suspended license, and a 27-year-old passenger was wanted for a parole violation, he said.\nKoch also disavowed a man who police said was driving a stolen vehicle to the demonstration.\nReach reporter Nigel Duara on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/nigelduara\n \nLOAD-DATE: December 13, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newswire\nCopyright 2011 Associated Press\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Portland", "article_number": "6046", "filename": "6046Portland, OR-theassociatedpressstatelocalwire-09.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-13", "state": "OR", "version": "30", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "theassociatedpressstatelocalwire", "periodical_code": "09"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 156, "uuid": "0fcfb9ac-70cd-4603-8d72-80792df6615c", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 156, "uuid": "29247b97-9e6d-41f8-b7c7-984217e3bd81", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 755, "uuid": "5cd270b1-6660-4c53-8ca2-566b7851fb0a", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[205, 254, "Port of Portland closes 2 terminals after arrests"], [255, 443, "The Port of Portland shut down two of its four terminals on Monday after police arrested two people and seized weapons in the hours before a demonstration by the Anti-Wall Street movement."], [444, 605, "Security concerns were raised when police found the suspects in camouflage clothing with a gun, sword and walkie-talkies who said they were doing reconnaissance."], [606, 726, "Kari Koch, a spokeswoman for Occupy Portland, said the two people taken into custody were not part of the demonstration."], [727, 775, "\"We do not send out folks with guns,\" Koch said."], [1162, 1351, "200 workers from the longshoremen's union, which said it sympathized with the goals of the Occupy movement but disagreed with shutting down operations that would deprive its members of pay."], [1536, 1600, "The full economic impact of the move was not yet known, he said."], [2355, 2576, "About 100 people stood at Terminal 5, with 12 police officers on bicycles between the protesters and the street.

The move comes one day after a few dozen protestors moved from the Civic Center Plaza, where they had been since Oct. 7, to outside a Bank of America branch office to decry the conduct of banks, corporations, political elites and political power brokers.\nAbout 1:30 p.m. Thursday, Bank of America on B Street closed four and a half hours early due to the 30 to 40 Occupy protestors who sat in a loose circle in front of the branch, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.\nSan Diego police Capt. Mark Jones told the newspaper that the protest was allowed to continue because no one's bank access was being restricted and the protesters were in areas open to the public.\nProtester Kevin Rambo, 18, told the Union-Tribune that his group aimed to call attention to the Occupy movement, which began in New York last month and has since spread nationwide. The fact that the branch closed early was a secondary benefit, he said.\nThe Wells Fargo Bank branch slated to be targeted today is also on B Street.\nThe Occupy movement in San Diego has been largely confrontation-free, with only two protestors being arrested for allegedly delaying police officers as they attempted to remove makeshift camp sites from the Civic Center Plaza last Friday.\nProtesters have vowed to remain in the downtown area until their demands are met or at least sincerely considered.

Besides, isn't that precisely why the city wants to move the camp out of the Financial District -- to clear out the sanitary and safety concerns on Justin Herman Plaza?\n\"It's insane,\" resident Roberto Hernandez told the Chron. \"Not one meeting to ask us what we might think. We have enough problems here in the Mission.\"\nThe city laid out its generous offer to relocate the camp from Justin Herman Plaza near the Financial District to a more appropriate setting along Mission and 16th streets -- on the grounds of a former high school. The city even offered to pay rent on the property, which belongs to the San Francisco Unified School District (we are certain SFUSD is eager to accept the much-needed cash). It's a hard deal to turn down, considering the site comes with running water and working toilets.\nYet Occupy protesters are divided on whether to stay or go ; some say it's time to move the camp and weed out the bad seeds, while others believe they should be near the very banks they are protesting. Moving to the Mission would put the camp out of site, out of mind.\nThe city gave the camp a noon deadline last Wednesday to make a decision, but that day came and went and protesters remained camped out on the plaza. At one point, police barricaded the camp, leading protesters to believe a raid was imminent.

It limits the encampment to three portable toilets, two propane heaters and one generator. It would forbid clotheslines between the park's trees and open flames for cooking, including \"Coleman-style\" camp stoves.\n\"No permanent or semipermanent structures or signs shall be maintained on the premises. No tents larger than those tents presently on the premises are allowed,\" the memo says. It also would limit the encampment to 30 tents.\nThe number has fluctuated, but there are around 50 tents in the park; a voluntary census Saturday night registered 36 tents.\nThe memo would also release the city from liability for injuries within the encampment.\nMost of the its provisions are tailored to the protest, an offshoot of Manhattan's Occupy Wall Street raising concerns about economic inequality and corporate power, in its current form. While some demonstrators have talked of the need to erect more permanent shelter -- perhaps a yurt with a woodstove -- Occupy Albany has made no concrete moves to do so.\nMishler and eight other protesters met Tuesday with public safety officials in City Hall to discuss concerns around the protests, and Albany Fire Chief Robert Forrezzi led an inspection of the encampment Wednesday.\nWhile Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings at first said he would enforce an 11 p.m. curfew in the park -- after discussions with top aides to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said they would enforce a similar curfew in adjacent Lafayette Park -- city police officials and Albany County District Attorney David Soares resisted.\nThe result has been detente between the occupation and the city's government, i n contrast to cities like Rochester, where police are arresting demonstrators almost nightly for violating park curfews.\nBut the memo may be a step too far toward normalization, several demonstrators said Sunday evening. Mishler presented the document to over three dozen demonstrators for discussion, many of whom wondered if Occupy Albany could ever sign it.\n\"What would that signature even mean?\" Mishler asked, noting the fluid nature of the protest.\nWhile no formal action can be taken before the encampment's nightly general assembly Monday night, the three dozen demonstrators agreed to a five-part proposal that including not signing the document.\nThe proposed response would also reiterate thanks to the City for respecting and enforcing protections of First Amendment rights, declare understanding for the city's need to regulate health and safety and reiterate its own policies and actions.\nThey also agreed to invite city officials to their nightly general assemblies and reiterate their continued commitment to dialogue.\nIt's unclear what the city's next move will be.

By 5:30 p.m., the marchers had dispersed, with some heading back to the park trailed by about six police officers on motorcycles.\nRobert Derenthal, 21, of Marietta, a student at Kennesaw State, told the AJC Wednesday he had been at the protest since Saturday in the hopes that \"others will start to make their voices known about the abusive practices of Wall Street and investment banking and banking throughout this country ... that people need to start to realize there are reasons why we have such high unemployment in this country, underemployment, why people are being thrown out of their homes, why there has been no recovery and it's time for that frustration to get out into the streets.\"\nMeanwhile, Mayor Kasim Reed told members of the City Council\u2019s public safety committee that, while the city wants to respect the demonstrators\u2019 right to express their views, they cannot be allowed to camp in the park indefinitely.\n\u201cThis has got to got to come to a close at some point,\u201d Reed said. \u201cAt some point, we have to act.\u201d\nReed said the group calling itself Occupy Atlanta is damaging the public park and violating Atlanta\u2019s laws, and to ignore it opens the door to more law-breaking in the future.\n\u201cI do worry that we are setting precedents,\u201d Reed said. Giving exemptions to the law \u201cis creating a real problem for us.\u201d\nCommittee chair Ivory Lee Young Jr. said he appreciated Reed\u2019s concerns, but he suggested that arresting protesters might be unwise.\n\u201cArrests, at this point, don\u2019t serve any of our purposes,\u201d he told Reed during the meeting.\nReed said his staff had conducted a detailed review of how other cities had dealt with the Occupy Wall Street offshoots, and would be ready to brief the City Council on Wednesday.\nBoston police made national headlines Tuesday morning by arresting more than 100 protesters who were attempting to expand their encampment from a park to an adjacent roadway greenbelt. Video showed black-clad officers hauling away protesters who chanted, \u201cWe are veterans of the United States of America!\u201d An American flag that had apparently been knocked from the hands of one protester lay on the ground as those nearby chanted, \u201cShame, shame, shame!\u201d\nIn Atlanta, meanwhile, a spokesman for Reed said the city will not immediately try to break up the protesters\u2019 encampment, which on Tuesday afternoon numbered about 30 tents. \u201cAs long as they\u2019re there peacefully, for the time time being, we\u2019re going to allow them to stay,\u201d said Reese McCranie, the mayor\u2019s deputy director of communications. \u201cThat may change in the future or may not change.\u201d\nOne camper applauded the decision. \u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d said Phil Aliff, 25, a student at Kennesaw State University. \u201cI hope they let us stay here indefinitely. Our side can win if we continue to bring people out.\u201d\nOccupy Atlanta, rallying against corporate greed and the war in Afghanistan, set up stakes in the park Friday night. The crowd\u2019s size varied through the weekend.\nReed said the protesters have presented him with a list of demands. They want the park renamed for Troy Anthony Davis, the man executed last month for murdering a Savannah police officer. Second, the protesters want Reed to camp with them overnight in the park. Third, they want assurances that they won\u2019t be arrested.\nReed said he was praying about whether he should sleep in the park. But he refused to give assurances that no one would be arrested.\nAs for renaming Woodruff Park? \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Reed said.\nStaff photographer John Spink contributed to this article.", "metadata": {"city": "Atlanta", "article_number": "476", "filename": "476Atlanta-theatlantajournalconstitution-09.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-02", "state": null, "version": "24", "annotators": ["NBA", "SLG"], "periodical": "theatlantajournalconstitution", "periodical_code": "09"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 125, "uuid": "43889b86-51c7-4bb8-a3dc-068cab06645f", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 125, "uuid": "3294b6b8-0b8a-4eb8-bc21-148c7c4ae79b", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 583, "uuid": "fc0fe3c7-f726-47dd-b229-553ea45b2b5d", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[448, 661, "As about 150 protesters stood outside the Bank of America on Peachtree Street on Tuesday afternoon, a security guard escorted employees from the building.

Forty individuals were arrested in front of Civic Center Plaza on Third St. and later, police arrested 11 additional protesters in Children's Park in downtown San Diego moments later.\nRaw Video: Warning Graphic Language\nWhen an officer using a bullhorn demanded the group disperse, protesters responded chanting \"This is what democracy looks like.\"\nMembers of the public and employees in nearby buildings complained to the police of human and animal feces, drug use and litter on the premises. That, in addition to the numerous violations of city codes and state laws, led police to their decision, said Assistant Chief of Police Boyd Long at a Friday morning press conference.\n\"The driving factor was the unsanitary conditions,\" Long said.\nAfter the press conference at the SDPD headquarters, members of the occupation gathered and chanted that they wanted their people back.\nPrior to the late-night raid, police said they made efforts to mediate with protestors, utilizing professional mediators from the National Conflict Resolution Center to try to reach an agreement. Long said despite these attempts, protesters were unwilling to move their private posessions from the public property.\n\"These are not the kind of negotiations we\u2019re used to \u2013 with this leaderless group,\" said San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne at the press conference during a question and answer session.\nPolice attempted to move the tents out of the Civic Center Plaza occupation on Oct. 14, resulting in two arrests. Since then, several tents were moved back in, and many protesters slept on the plaza at night.\n\u201cWe chose the night we did because we figured there would be the smallest number of people there,\u201d Long said.\nMany of those who watched the police action were screaming that the officers were part of the 99% and singing patriotic songs.\nAbraham Roloff with Occupy San Diego explained his experience just after midnight in Children's Park where he was camping overnight as part of the movement:\n\"They gave us no verbal warning whatsoever, they grabbed anybody who stood in their way even if their hands were up, threw them to the ground and arrested them. we asked repeatedly if we could have a few minutes to collect our personal belongings and they had nothing to say, absolute silence,\" said Roloff.\nLong said police did give two verbal warnings before moving to arrest the protesters. At that point, a few protesters moved out, but many stayed.\nMore Raw Video: Warning Graphic Language\nOccupy San Diego participants said the arrests were unfair and claimed police brutality for arresting observers and protesters. Lansdowne said he witnessed no force issues.\n\u201cThere was one young woman who was simply filming them with her iPhone and they reached out, grabbed her arm, put it behind her back and arrested her without any kind of warning,\u201d said one witness.\nOfficers later erected water-filled barriers around the Civic Center to keep people out of the area. They will be cleaning the plaza, and say protesters can return once they finish cleaning -- but cannot move their property back in.\nProtesters say they are seeking out a privately-owned piece of land to continue their stand against corporate greed and income disparities in the country.\nIn response, San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders said the actions taken by police were justified.\n\"The City of San Diego, of course, supports anyone\u2019s right to protest. However, when health and safety issues arise, or when protesters fail to comply with the law, appropriate action must be taken,\" Sanders said in a statement.\nKevin Keenan, Executive Director of the ACLU, spoke with Landsdowne Friday afternoon and voiced his concerns\n\"I urged the chief to drop the charges, release the protesters, and find an alternative space and way to accommodate overnight protest activity,\" he said in a statement,\" Keenan wrote in a statement.\nSDPD confirms that later in the day two more protesters were arrested.\nOne person was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon after police said they threw a can at an Sgt., hitting them in the face.

A woman reported Friday that $1,800 was taken from her, and she also claimed she had been assaulted.\n\"They're free to protest with their signs, voices, music and dance all day long, but this isn't a conversation about greed and Wall Street -- this is about a campout,\" said the mayor, who wants the campout to end. \"I don't think there's any park -- city or national -- in the country that allows for perpetual campouts.\"\nLast week, 11 News reporter Lowell Melser uploaded a photo of Occupy Baltimore members playing video games at the location.\nNegotiations between the city and the protesters are nonexistent because the group has not identified a leader or any collective goals, 11 News reporter Kerry Cavanaugh said. Protesters said they're denouncing issues ranging from corporate greed to campaign finance reform.\n\n\nBALTIMORE -\n\"Generally, just trying to educate the public and keep the conversation alive. If there's a huge disconnect between the people and the government, I can't help but think that the ideas of our founding fathers are being slowly ripped away from us,\" said protester Jason O'Neal.\nThe protesters are vowing to continue their vigil while they explore other avenues to power computers, charge cellphones and make the coffee that keeps them warm.\nGroup members were told last week that only two people could camp out overnight at the site and act as \"watchmen.\" City leaders said at the time that they respected the free speech rights of the members but said McKeldin Square wasn't a campground.\nThe group applied for a permit for 25 to 300 people last month to express solidarity with Occupy Wall Street, a demonstration in New York City against corporate influence, according to Department of Recreation and Parks spokeswoman Gwendolyn Burrell Chambers.\nGroup members have been at the site since Oct. 4.\nOrganizers originally said the protest didn?t have any one particular ideology. Instead, they hoped it was an opportunity for people to come together and talk about ways to address local concerns.\nStay with WBALTV.com and WBAL-TV 11 News for updates.\n\n\nLink: http://www.wbaltv.com/City-Cuts-Off-Power-At-Occupy-Baltimore-Site/-/9380084/8903918/-/rn5cn4z/-/index.html#ixzz24EtNAj31", "metadata": {"city": "Baltimore", "article_number": "919", "filename": "919Baltimore-WBALTV11-12.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-03", "state": null, "version": "26", "annotators": ["EDC"], "periodical": "WBALTV11", "periodical_code": "12"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 216, "uuid": "f56f7602-644a-40b0-a8a5-6a41ac29ce85", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 216, "uuid": "bb24b7d7-59ed-4301-8592-7de3ec0f36a2", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 1059, "uuid": "a2543377-ac36-4c7c-a4eb-7047c5de5733", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[2832, 2881, "Group members have been at the site since Oct. 4."], [193, 208, "McKeldin Square"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 176, "article_number": 6931, "uri": "urn:article:6931:89a36d2e-37e9-40b4-babd-3d81936ee307", "sha256": "ee09f60fbf32bb8c4f93ddf8db0cfdfa25beaa2d76795daf0bd147f647e672d2", "batch_name": "article", "text": "10 of 18 DOCUMENTS\nNovember 17, 2011 Thursday 10:33 AM GMT\nLENGTH: 215 words\n\n\nOccupy San Francisco protesters arrested after taking over Bank of America;\nPolice arrested scores of anti-Wall Street protesters in San Francisco on Wednesday after they occupied a Bank of America branch in the city's financial district.\nDemonstrators flooded into the bank during an organised march that began at the protesters' downtown encampment and ended at a state office building a few blocks away.\nThe group set up a tent inside the bank branch as more than 100 bystanders watched from outside and police in riot helmets arrested the occupiers one by one, bringing them to a waiting bus.\nOne protester waved a sign inside that read \"make banks pay.\" Another held up a sign to a local television station that said they were protesting the link between California's public higher education system and the banks.\nThe protesters chanted \"we are the 99 per cent\" as they were arrested, alluding to the richest 1 per cent of the U.S. population that the activists say control a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth and power.\nOfficer Albie Esparza, a police department spokesman, said 95 demonstrators were arrested in connection with Wednesday's bank protest, most on suspicion of trespassing.

There were no reports\nof injuries or complaints of abuse, he said.\nThe camp had become an unbearable drain on city resources, an economic threat to\nnearby businesses and a danger to public safety, Mayor Jean Quan said.\n\"The encampment became a place where we had repeated violence and this week a\nmurder. We had to bring the camp to an end before more people were hurt,\" she\nsaid.\nThe developments in Oakland come amid rising concern from city officials around\nthe country that the protests drain resources and threaten public health. What\nstarted as the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York in September has spread\nacross cities worldwide as a call to action against unequal distribution of\nwealth and other issues.\nIn Oregon, Portland police made more than 50 arrests Sunday as they cleared two\nparks -- Chapman and Lownsdale Square -- of protesters.\nPolice called in reinforcements from surrounding jurisdictions, and more than\n300 officers took part in the sweep -- which went off without incident,\nauthorities said.\n\"We acted proactively,\" Portland Mayor Sam Adams told reporters on Monday. \"We\nwere not going to wait until somebody died in a camp.\"\nHe thanked police and other city employees for their work and encouraged\nprotesters to find a new outlet.\n\"I hope that this Occupy Wall Street movement will focus and pivot and realize\nits potential as a national and international movement.,\" he said.\nIn Philadelphia, Mayor Michael Nutter said Sunday that what started as a\npeaceful protest 39 days ago has given way to increasing public safety and\npublic health concerns.\n\"Occupy Philly has changed,\" Nutter said. \"We're seeing serious health and\nsafety issues playing out on an almost daily basis. ... The people of Occupy\nPhilly have also changed and their intentions have changed. And all of this is\nnot good for Philadelphia.\"\nA woman reported she was sexually assaulted Saturday night in a tent at the\nencampment, Nutter said. CNN affiliate WPVI reported a suspect was arrested in\nthe alleged assault.\nThe mayor also cited the threat of fire near historic City Hall and concerns\nabout litter, public urination, defecation and graffiti.\nNumerous reports of thefts and assaults in the encampment have been made, and 15\nemergency medical runs were made between October 6 and November 11, he said.\nProtesters are also blocking a planned $50 million renovation at Dilworth Plaza,\nwhere they are camping, threatening jobs of workers on the project, Nutter said.\nThe protesters are \"purposely standing in the way of nearly 1,000 jobs for\nPhiladelphians at a time of high unemployment,\" Nutter said. \"They are blocking\nPhiladelphians from taking care of their families.\"\n\"We have things we need to do,\" Nutter said. \"I understand that they have things\non their mind as Americans and wish to express their free speech. I understand\nthat, I get that, I've defended that. The things we're talking about, the\nactivities that are going on, are not about free speech. They're public health\nand public safety concerns that have nothing to do with Wall Street and\ncorporations.\"\nIn Denver, police arrested three protesters on Sunday, a day after taking 17\npeople into custody in a dispute over clearing furniture and tents that city\nofficials said were blocking a right of way.\nPolice in Tulsa, Oklahoma, arrested six people and issued four citations for\nremaining in a park past curfew Sunday night, Officer Jason Willingham said.\nIn Nashville, authorities dismissed charges against 55 Occupy protesters who had\nbeen given trespassing citations. The protesters had been demonstrating at the\nstate Capitol grounds.\nThe prosecutor in the case asked that the charges be dismissed, and the judge\nagreed, Tennessee General Sessions Court administrator Warner Hassell said.\nThe Oakland operation will likely cost the city between $300,000 and $500,000,\nCity Administrator Deanna Santana said.\nCity officials planned to clean up the plaza and reopen it to protests by Monday\nevening.\nJordan said city officials will enforce a ban on camping in the park with an\naround-the-clock police presence. But he said peaceful demonstrators would be\nallowed to remain at the site around the clock, if they wished, so long as they\ndon't bring tents, sleeping bags or other \"lodging equipment.\"\n\"If you're not breaking the laws, we're not concerned about your presence,\" he\nsaid.\nThe plaza was one of two Occupy camps in the city. The other, at Snow Park,\nremained standing. Jordan said police would not move against that camp on\nMonday, but added it could be dismantled later.\nProtesters are meanwhile looking for a private space from which to protest, city\nofficials said.\nThe decision to clear the plaza prompted a longtime friend of Quan who described\nhimself as her legal adviser to resign.\n\"No longer Mayor Quan's legal advisor. Resigned at 2 am. Support Occupy Oakland,\nnot the 1% and its government facilitators,\" attorney Dan Siegel said in the\npost, which Siegel confirmed to CNN was accurate.\nCity spokeswoman Susan Piper described Siegel as a \"volunteer adviser.\"\n\n\nLOAD-DATE: November 15, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nNOTES: Update 6:30 p.m. -- Adds details on Portland protests in grafs 6-10;\ntrims\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newswire\nCopyright 2011 Cable News Network\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Oakland", "article_number": "5128", "filename": "5128Oakland-cnnwire-11.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-14", "state": null, "version": "31", "annotators": ["SLG"], "periodical": "cnnwire", "periodical_code": "11"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 138, "uuid": "ea53ba79-1786-4afc-8881-a51bb2d6772d", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 138, "uuid": "9c6b7116-d717-492f-9a4e-eb6be47cd6cc", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 632, "uuid": "fa584988-3c91-42c4-883a-cc03d4c405c3", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[198, 247, "Police in riot gear moved into the Occupy Oakland"], [248, 316, "encampment Monday, tearing down tents and arresting some protesters,"], [472, 540, "Oakland, California, police, aided by dozens of officers from nearby"], [541, 620, "jurisdictions, arrested 32 people in the effort to clear Frank Ogawa Plaza near"], [621, 643, "City Hall before dawn,"], [678, 699, "There were no reports"], [700, 735, "of injuries or complaints of abuse,"]]}, {"id": 633, "uuid": "edf8eaf2-c56b-4715-8ad2-1da85e35e700", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 3, "offsets": [[4732, 4765, "around-the-clock police presence."]]}, {"id": 634, "uuid": "202df234-c1e8-479b-879e-28e3fe3ace0f", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 2, "offsets": [[644, 677, "Interim Chief Howard Jordan said."], [736, 744, "he said."]]}, {"id": 635, "uuid": "3193ced3-1310-484a-91db-ac3dbcfb05a7", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 4, "offsets": [[5133, 5187, "Jordan said police would not move against that camp on"], [5188, 5195, "Monday,"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 160, "article_number": 6049, "uri": "urn:article:6049:4abcc80a-5173-4e81-b85f-1b504c515c45", "sha256": "f220dab1be7bc1088385787ae9a02eeb987557687dbccdd81ef419a3ea319098", "batch_name": "article", "text": "6 of 27 DOCUMENTS\nContra Costa Times (California)\nDecember 12, 2011 Monday\nBlog: Two APL terminals blocked\nBYLINE: By Kristin J. Bender, Katy Murphy, Paul Thissen, Josh Richman, Robert Salonga, Thomas Peele, Paul Rosynsky and Harry Harris Bay Area News Group\nSECTION: MY TOWN; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; News; World; Local\nLENGTH: 2966 words\n \n3 a.m. Protesters block two APL terminals\nAbout 150 protesters remained through the night and are now blocking two APL terminals. Workers are unable to enter and some are arguing with protesters.\nA van carrying some Oakland police officers drove by and checked out the scene, but there was no police activity otherwise.\n10:35 p.m. Mayor Jean Quan calls protest 'economic violence'\nOakland Mayor Jean Quan blasted the port actions today as \"economic violence\" and questioned the motives of protesters who are threatening to disrupt another shift Tuesday morning.\n\"While we have not had physical violence, the economic violence to this city is just not fair,\" Quan said at a press briefing Monday evening. \"... A small group of people are going to hold this port, this city, this economy hostage. It's not fair to the workers. It is not fair to this city. This city has been very generous to the 99 percent movement. This city has been very supportive.\"\nShe called on protesters to \"think about the consequences\" of their protest, especially as a group is threatening to shut down a 3 a.m. shift.\n\"The people who are planning to stay at the port -- do they have families who have trucks that because of the slowdown in the economy may lose those trucks? A day's pay -- $600, $700 -- could be the difference as to whether they can keep that truck or not.\n\"People have to think about who are they hurting. They are saying, 'We want to get the attention of the ruling class.' Well, I think the ruling class is probably laughing, and people in this city will be crying this Christmas. It's really got to stop.\"\nInterim Police Chief Howard Jordon reminded demonstrators that \"while peaceful forms of expression and free speech rights will be facilitated, acts of violence, property destruction and overnight lodging will not be tolerated.\"\nPort of Oakland officials said that terminals are sticking to their regular schedules with no truck or gate operations planned for Monday night.\nQuan urged participants in the protests to respect workers who are trying to get home from the port and maintain safety and security, and avoid violence or damage to maritime area facilities.\n10 p.m. Crowd moves to APL Terminal\nAbout 200 remaining protesters have migrated from the Hanjin terminal on Middle Harbor Road to the APL terminal. Three tents have been pitched in the road, and protesters are eating and relaxing while still vowing to wait and regroup for a planned shut down of the 3 a.m. shift at some terminals.\n9:30 p.m. Less than 100 remain at Hanjin terminal\nAt the Port of Oakland, the mood is festive as people dance to music from a truck with a sound system, chat and mill around. Many are now walking east down Middle Harbor Road out of the port and say they plan to go home to eat, sleep and warm up and the return at 1:30 a.m. to gear up for a 3 a.m. blockage. It's not clear how many plan to do that.\nMeanwhile, organizers are directing people to go to the APL terminal near the Adeline bridge and for supporters to bring supplies there. Organizers say they plan a march from 7th and Adeline streets at 12:45 a.m.\n8:50 p.m. Mayor Jean Quan speaks out against continuing protest\nAt a press briefing earlier, Mayor Jean Quan said she had planned to thank everyone for being peaceful, until she found out that protesters planned to continue blocking the Port of Oakland into Tuesday morning.\n\"The economic violence is just not fair,\" she said. \"The people who are planning to stay at the port, do they have family who have trucks? ... People have to think about who they are hurting.\n\"I think the 1 percent are probably laughing and people in this city are crying,\" Quan said.\nInterim Police Chief Howard Jordan said police plan to monitor protesters' activity Monday evening and into Tuesday morning and take \"appropriate action\" at the right time.\nRegular activity continues inside the port, but with no unloading or trucking, said Port of Oakland Executive Director Omar Benjamin.\nThere are three ships berthed at the port that were not unloaded Monday because of the strike; the plan is to unload them Tuesday, he said.\n\"Operations at the port's seven terminals experienced disruptions and delays,\" Benjamin said. \"(Monday's) disruptions have been costly to port workers and their families.\"\nOakland police had not yet made any mutual aid calls Monday, Jordan said. However, some Alameda County Sheriff's deputies were called in advance to assist. The city will pay those costs, he said.\n8:15 p.m. Protesters asking for help, supplies, food, blankets\nAbout 1,000 protesters remain at the Port, but only about 100 have indicated that they are willing to stay until 3 a.m. to try and shutdown the early morning shift. Protesters have put out a call to supporters asking for warm clothes, food and blankets as they continue the protest into the night and early hours of the morning.\nMeanwhile, reporters at the Hanjin terminal are having trouble finding people willing to be interviewed by what they call the \"corporate media.\" One radio reporter says a protester urinated on the news van, then swore at them while telling them to \"get lost.\"\n7:45 p.m. General assembly decides to block 3 a.m. shift\nThe Occupy Oakland general assembly has decided, without a vote, to continue the Port of Oakland blockage for the 3 a.m. Tuesday shift. The decision was based on claims that Occupy movements on the West Coast faced arrests and stun grenades Monday.\nHowever, many Occupy protesters appear not willing to stay until 3 a.m. The group is now attempting to determine how many people want to stay and how many want to leave.\n7 p.m. Trucks being loaded at Howard Terminal\nWhile Port of Oakland activity seems halted elsewhere, work is still under way at one Port of Oakland terminal. Workers are loading and unloading trucks at the Howard Terminal near Jack London Square. At the Hanjin Terminal, the Occupy Oakland group is holding its general assembly to decide whether to extend the blockade until 3 a.m. Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, Port of Oakland and city officials will brief the media about the day's events at 8 p.m.\n6 p.m. General assembly to decide on blockade\nA large crowd has gathered at Hanjin shipping, terminals 55 and 66. A general assembly will be held to determine whether to extend the port blockade until the next shift, at 3 a.m.\nThere's a dozen trucks waiting to get in; the first one has a load of meat from Kansas. Its driver, Lee Ranaldson, said he'd probably lost $1,000 today.\n\"The ones they are fighting against are at home. They already made their money today,\" he said.\n5:30 p.m. People climb atop semitrucks\nThe march has arrived at the Hanjin terminal. There's a line of blocked semi trucks in the middle of the road, and a half dozen people have climbed on top of one of them. There are seven TV trucks and helicopters, but still no police presence.\n5:15 p.m. Fireworks at port\nAs people march through the port, a small fireworks display briefly lit up the night. Otherwise, there appears to be little activity in the terminals.\n4:55 p.m. Protesters arrive at Port of Oakland\nAs three helicopters hover overhead, thousands of protesters are entering the port, a much larger crowd than there was at the early morning action. One group of activists is carrying a tent, and there's three helicopters overhead. There's no immediate sign of police.\n4:30 p.m. A lively procession\nThe march to West Oakland, now perhaps 1,000 strong, is turning onto Adeline. Music is blasting from a flatbed truck that was rented for the occasion. People are playing drums and dancing, about six blocks deep.\n4:10 p.m. The march begins\nHundreds of protesters have left Frank Ogawa Plaza for the Port of Oakland, chanting, \"Whose street?

They didn't want to call it a walkout. For an afternoon, students and professors sat outside and huddled under blankets while doing homework and writing on a chalkboard. The issue: the suggestion by Cooper Union's president that the school might, for the first time in its history, have to charge tuition like other schools do. The walkout wrapped up later on indoors with a speech from new president Jamshed Bharucha.\nLater that month, City University of New York students threw down with police during a rally at Baruch College, a few subway stops north of where the Cooper Union walkout had occurred. It was timed to coincide with a hearing of the CUNY board of trustees to discuss a new round of proposed tuition hikes. Students refused to leave the lobby of Baruch as the trustees met upstairs, and the police moved in. \"We could hear the screams of people getting beat,\" says Fernanda Pardo, 23, a student organizer at John Jay College who was upstairs waiting outside the hearing. \"We were hysterical and crying.\" Fifteen were arrested and detained.\nBoth protests were part of a current resurgence in student activism in New York that has coincided with the Occupy Wall Street action\u2014there was also a short-lived New School occupation, and there has been some activity from something called NYU 4 OWS. The activism at New York City colleges is filling the void as OWS struggles to find its way, but it's taking different forms across town.\nA large portion of Cooper's money comes from its real estate holdings, the value of which has been dropping. The school has had to resort to selling off assets and skimming off the principal of its endowment in order to continue its no-tuition policy.\nCooper senior Ryan Evell told the Voice last month that \"if Cooper starts charging tuition, that would be as radical as Harvard saying that everyone who gets in gets a full scholarship.\" Evell also referred to the possible tuition charges as a \"sad loss not just for New York but for the entire nation.\" But the school that's \"as free as air and water\" is the only one of its kind in the country, and its policy is starting to look quaint, especially for a small private school in the middle of an economic downturn.\nA public institution designed to serve New York City's working class, CUNY hasn't been free since 1975, and it is increasingly less free as time goes on. The board of trustees approved a new set of tuition hikes on November 28, which will raise tuition by 31 percent over five years. This will manifest as a $300 increase each year.\nStudents at CUNY campuses saw the writing on the wall months ago and formed Students United for a Free CUNY over the summer. Their timing matched up to the origins of Occupy Wall Street, which in its early phase was a series of General Assemblies attended by organizers in Tompkins Square Park. The CUNY group consists of around 20 organizers from campuses across the city, including Pardo and Venetia Biney, a 22-year-old junior at Hunter College.\n\"I work full-time and go to school full-time,\" says Biney, a third-generation CUNY student. Of the tuition hikes, she said \"it's going to affect me immensely because I don't have my mom and dad to rely on.\"\nThat's a common story at CUNY, where many, if not most, students are working one or multiple jobs on top of classes, like Sarah Pomar, 25, a junior sociology major at Hunter, who has two jobs and pays out of pocket for school. She has had to move back in with her parents.\n\"CUNY is a working-class public institution,\" Pomar says. \"You can justifiably assume that a lot of students are experiencing a lot of financial hardship.\"\nCUNY says it gives financial aid of some kind to 70 percent of full-time undergraduate students\u2014but the 30 percent left over in a system that includes close to 500,000 people is considerable. And under the new rules, qualifying for financial aid will become more difficult. As an aside, it's worth noting that CUNY chancellor Matthew Goldstein 's salary has nearly doubled in the past decade.\nThese are specific and targeted complaints directed toward a single entity, the type of messaging that Occupy Wall Street has famously never managed nor wanted to come up with. Pomar and others involved in Students United for a Free CUNY cited OWS as an inspiration, but not as a cause, for their actions against what Pardo called the \"gentrification of CUNY.\"\n\"Occupy Wall Street provided a place for all these social justice movements to intersect and build,\" Pomar says. This has been on display at the CUNY protests, which lately include a strong union presence and a smattering of original Occupy Wall Streeters.\nAt the end of November, those unions and OWS people joined up with CUNY students for a large rally at Baruch while the board of trustees voted on the tuition hikes. The hikes passed. Meanwhile, students at Cooper Union organized an art show at the Foundation building about free tuition. It ran for four days to little buzz.\nEven without better results, Fernanda Pardo, the John Jay student, feels encouraged. \"People are starting to get the hint.\"", "metadata": {"city": "NewYork", "article_number": "4797", "filename": "4797NewYork-www.villagevoice.comnews-06.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-07", "state": null, "version": "30", "annotators": ["NBA"], "periodical": "www.villagevoice.comnews", "periodical_code": "06"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 126, "uuid": "d5eaa50a-e0f2-4e4b-997e-1527893d5756", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 126, "uuid": "71c073b1-72ed-4024-b177-46b6878d62bb", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 589, "uuid": "70897661-cd2d-44d0-98cd-6451a032a23c", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[4905, 5068, "At the end of November, those unions and OWS people joined up with CUNY students for a large rally at Baruch while the board of trustees voted on the tuition hikes"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 99, "article_number": 4069, "uri": "urn:article:4069:9218242c-f063-4124-8bf5-c480af7d00cd", "sha256": "f47f8caa5a66d57e351a2e521dfd983dc22bc4010540e0b6a765c1f17be324b7", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Occupy Memphis protesters celebrate Thanksgiving holiday\nSubmitted by Anna Marie Hartman, Anchor/Reporter\nThursday, November 24th, 2011, 5:24pm\nTopics: News\n\n\n\nMEMPHIS, TN-\n(WMC-TV) - Last year at this time, many of the Occupy Memphis protesters were sitting down to a Thanksgiving dinner with family.

The park, at the intersection of Main and Akard streets, \u201cis the best choice for a new location to optimize the public visibility of our movement.\u201d\nHotels, restaurants and lofts surround the park. Twenty-three Occupy Dallas demonstrators were arrested last month for blocking the entrance to a Chase bank nearby.\nThe influence of and prospects for the Occupy Movement here and elsewhere are unclear. For now, the local plan puts protesters at Pegasus Park between 5 a.m. to 11 p.m., when it is open to the public. And it has them walking sidewalks nearby when the park is closed overnight.\n\u201cThe city of Dallas will have no grounds for our removal so long as we maintain presence in the park (during legal hours) and then continue on the sidewalk after hours,\u201d Prestonise wrote in the proposal.\nBut attorney Jonathan Winocour told the group Monday night that the city might try to enforce ordinances, such as limits on noise and a prohibition against attracting a crowd on a sidewalk by \u201cloud talking, unusual acts or exhibitions.\u201d\nWinocour also urged the group to respect the park property, to avoid damaging trees or littering. \u201cIf you are going to occupy the space, treat it as your home,\u201d he said.\nInspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement, the local protesters have delivered wide-ranging messages decrying corporate greed, the widening wealth gap and a political system they say is corrupt and unresponsive to all but the powerful.\nSince the first Occupy Dallas demonstration Oct. 6, police and other city officials have said they respect and will protect the protesters\u2019 rights to free speech and assembly as long as they don\u2019t violate city laws.\nThe city gave the group a permit to camp at Pioneer Plaza and then let the protesters temporarily settle near City Hall on Oct. 17 with conditions, such as no fires, cooking, signs or toilets at the site.\nCiting violations and health and safety concerns at the camp, the city rescinded the agreement last Wednesday. And early Thursday, more than 100 police officers, some in riot gear, stepped in, removing tents and arresting 18 people without resistance. The misdemeanor charge: occupying an area closed to the public between midnight and 5 a.m. The fine: $184.\nThe loss of the campsite shouldn\u2019t be a setback for the group, said Dr. Lloyd Jeff Dumas, a professor of political economy, economics and public policy at the University of Texas at Dallas.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to be sleeping in a park to make a difference,\u201d he said.", "metadata": {"city": "Dallas", "article_number": "1959", "filename": "1959Dallas-DallasNews.com-02.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-22", "state": null, "version": "28", "annotators": ["EN"], "periodical": "DallasNews.com", "periodical_code": "02"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 31, "uuid": "a20e4337-cb5d-43b2-846a-67ac827b5ebe", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 31, "uuid": "53926b0b-5b37-482b-a15d-ed5901969345", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 139, "uuid": "9f0680c9-4133-4bce-a166-8708bcaea7fa", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[174, 224, "Days after police ended their stay near City Hall,"], [2588, 2835, "And early Thursday, more than 100 police officers, some in riot gear, stepped in, removing tents and arresting 18 people without resistance.

Local demonstrators have invited visitors to come to Iowa and take part in the rallies as the political world focuses on Iowa and its leadoff presidential nominating contest Jan. 3.\nProtesters say they will keep the protests civil, but many have said they will risk arrest.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that that\u2019s not the case; we\u2019d love to be able to sit down with the candidates and share the concerns of the 99 percent and have a discourse,\u201d Griffis said.\n\u2014 Register staff writer Tiffany De Masters contributed to this story.\nLink: http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20111220/NEWS09/312200046/8-arrested-during-protest-Des-Moines", "metadata": {"city": "Des Moines", "article_number": "2439", "filename": "2439Des Moines-TheDesMoinesRegister-03.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-19", "state": null, "version": null, "annotators": ["D", "M"], "periodical": "TheDesMoinesRegister", "periodical_code": "03"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 47, "uuid": "298b6b40-6d54-4739-ad23-667b34188d5e", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 47, "uuid": "a2bd587b-11f8-42ac-aba1-933811fe0177", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 211, "uuid": "9f3ec909-36da-4ef5-80a8-b9b5fb8337da", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[198, 290, "Eight \"Occupy\" protesters were arrested at Iowa Democratic Party headquarters in Des Moines."], [420, 469, "Each was to be charged with criminal trespassing."], [470, 575, "These eight people were cited Monday for trespassing at Iowa Democratic Party headquarters in Des Moines:"], [900, 991, "two prominent Democratic Party sites in Des Moines after eight people were arrested Monday."], [1467, 1585, "But on Saturday, after a pair of protests at President Barack Obama\u2019s Des Moines campaign office at 621 E.

A goal is to make Occupy Norfolk a permanent movement, similar to New York's, where protester numbers have been growing for the past three weeks.\n\"Why should Norfolk miss out on a movement that could potentially affect the national dialogue on a political issue?\" he said. \" This is my first attempt at a political movement.

Occupy organizers hope that union members will not cross picket lines.\nBetween 7,000 and 10,000 people marched on the Port of Oakland the afternoon of Nov. 2, clogging the entrances and roadways. Although shipping terminals closed down early, some truckers were blocked by the sea of people as they tried to drive out.\nThe action extended into the evening and effectively shut down the port for the last two shifts of the day when dockworkers either couldn't get to work or stayed away to support the strike.\nThe Nov. 2 strike, coupled with a work stoppage by longshoremen at the SSA and Trapac terminals due to safety concerns over refrigerated shipping containers, created a backlog of cargo that took days to resolve.\n\"The union is not supporting it, is not coordinating the action with Occupy Oakland,\" said Richard Mead, president of ILWU, Local 10. \"We think that working people aren't getting a fair share and we support the principal of Occupy Wall Street, but we don't support shutting down our own jobs.\"\nIsaac Kos-Read, director of external affairs at the Port of Oakland, said the port is working with all its partners -- business, government and law enforcement -- to prevent any disruption in the flow of goods to and from the port.\n\"Disrupting operations will only hurt working people, here and throughout the state and country,\" Kos-Read said.\n\"This is an important time of year for us, a big time of year for exports. We are the export gateway for Northern California ... and this year is a bumper crop for almonds.\"\nKos-Read said that the frequent shut downs are a concern for companies that already do business with the port as well as those companies the port is trying to woo. Aside from the short-term impacts, the blockades and strikes could have lasting economic impacts for employers and workers throughout the region if companies choose other ports to move their goods, Kos-Read said.\n\"We want people to understand the impact on working people and our ability to create jobs,\" he said. \"The port is where the 99 percent work.\"\nBarucha Peller, a member of the Occupy Oakland blockade assembly, called that a \"right-wing analysis.\n\"Everyone from rank-and-file longshoremen to the port truckers realize we all have to make a sacrifice,\" she said. \"When we withdraw our labor, we make a (dent) in the 1 percent. Economic boycotts are very effective. The occupation movement is moving into a larger and more coherent strategy of how to disrupt the profits of the 1 percent.\"\nThe Dec. 12 action was hatched at Occupy Los Angeles when it voted to shut down SSA terminals at the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach in solidarity with truckers who were fired when they tried to unionize, Peller said.\nThe blockade quickly spread up and down the West Coast. Peller said Occupy Oakland joined the blockade in solidarity with Los Angeles and with ILWU members in Longview, Wash., who are battling against a plan to use nonunion labor at a new grain facility owned by EGT. She also said the West Coast blockade was in response to the coordinated attacks against Occupy camps around the country.\nThe blockade will begin with a 3 p.m. rally at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, followed by a 4 p.m. march to the Port of Oakland, Peller said. A separate group will gather at the West Oakland BART station at 5 p.m. before marching on the port, she said.\nPeller said the movement expects thousands of people to participate in the action, including many who hoped to replicate their experience on Nov. 2. She warned that any disruption or use of violence by law enforcement in any of the cities would be cause to extend the blockades.Inside\nProtesters build symbolic structure in Frank H. Ogawa plaza.

But his allegations have not been\nverified by authorities.\nAnother veteran, Scott Olsen, was also taken to Highland after suffering a\nsevere fracture to his skull during an Oct. 25 protest.\nThe spirit of the Occupy movement and general strike, however, continued Friday\nwhen a group of moms and their children called the \"Colorful Mamas of the 99\nPercent\" tried to enter Wells Fargo Bank in downtown.\nThe group supported both the Occupy Wall Street and Bank Transfer Day movements.\nAt least three moms closed their accounts before the bank locked its doors in\nresponse to the protest, which began about noon at the branch on Franklin\nStreet.\nMeanwhile, the city is still tallying the cost for police and city services\nutilized during the strike, which was fairly peaceful, though windows at\nmunicipal buildings at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza were broken, Whole Foods was damaged\nand sprayed with graffiti and other downtown banks and businesses were\nvandalized.\nThe tab to replace 18 broken windows in municipal buildings in the plaza is\nestimated at $20,000 to $25,000, city officials said.\nAnd about two-thirds of the 103 people arrested during melees that followed late\nWednesday and early Thursday were not from Oakland. People taken into custody\nfor failure to disperse and facing other charges came from as far away as Texas,\nMichigan, New York, Utah, New Jersey and Oregon.\nJust before midnight Wednesday, a group of people that police are calling\nanarchists started fires, tossed firecrackers into burning fires, broke windows\nand caused other destruction downtown. Most of the 103 people arrested were\ntaken in for remaining at \"the place of any riot, rout, or unlawful assembly,\nafter they have been warned to disperse,\" authorities said.\nOthers were arrested and accused of resisting arrest, assault with a deadly\nweapon, vandalism, battery on a police officer and a parole violation.\nOf the 103 arrested, 32 are from Oakland, 42 are from other Bay Area cities, 15\nare from other parts of California and nine are from out of state. Two of those\narrested were 17-year-old juveniles who were cited and released. One is from\nWashington, the other from San Mateo County. Hometowns for three of those\narrested were not released. Of those arrested, 92 were cited and 11 were kept in\ncustody.\nBART reported unusually heavy ridership Wednesday because so many people took\ntrains to the rallies. Some 391,000 rode BART, compared with 370,000 on a\ntypical weekday, said district spokesman Jim Allison. About 6,100 more than\nusual passengers exited the Oakland 12th Street station, he said\nThe group of 40 moms and children marched from Snow Park by Lake Merritt, where\nOccupy Oakland protesters still maintain about a dozen tents.\nThe 300 or so people living in the downtown camp arose Friday morning to chilly\ntemperatures but promised to stick it out, rain or shine. They have been\ncollecting blankets and extra tarps to keep out the rain and cold. People\nwandered around the camp Friday with their hoods up, drinking hot coffee and\ntrying to stay warm.\n\"I can survive any weather,\" said Kenaja Mwari, 23, of Oakland. Gesturing toward\nCity Hall, he added \"If we aren't going to let the people stop us, why would we\nlet some weather stop us?\"\nStaff writer Katy Murphy contributed to this report.\nLOAD-DATE: November 5, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nGRAPHIC:\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\nCopyright 2011 Contra Costa Newspapers\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Oakland", "article_number": "5047", "filename": "5047Oakland-contracostatimescalifornia-12.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-04", "state": null, "version": "32", "annotators": ["NBA"], "periodical": "contracostatimescalifornia", "periodical_code": "12"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 135, "uuid": "911e4018-3a7d-43f9-95a8-ee05ebe561f2", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 135, "uuid": "05a97740-298a-4676-a40e-2f3d0675dc08", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 621, "uuid": "71134e06-6e71-4da1-9599-f8bbdd4db04b", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[339, 368, "Nov. 2 Occupy Oakland general"], [369, 375, "strike"], [0, 0, ""], [430, 481, "thousands of protesters filled the streets downtown"], [1553, 1605, "strike, which was fairly peaceful, though windows at"], [1606, 1686, "municipal buildings at Frank H.

In the two months since Occupy Chapel Hill first set up tents on Franklin Street, the group has begin to make inroads with local congregations.\nOn Sunday, Occupy Chapel Hill protesters visited the United Church of Chapel Hill to discuss the congregation's feelings about the movement, allow protesters to explain their goals, and to find points of unity.\nBoth aim for a loving community and eradication of social injustice, said members of both groups.\n\"The movement is about having a beloved community and about how people treat each other,\" said Steve Peterson, an Occupy supporter and church member. \"And it looks a lot different from how we're living now.\"\nPrior to the service, Tom Tiemann, an economics professor from Elon University and member of the church, set the stage for th e \"99 percent\" argument.\nHe described wealth distribution in the United States, saying the top 1 percent of American's make about $500,000 per year, compared to the bottom 50 percent who make less than $60,000.\nHowever, Tiemann said that the real problem was within the top one-tenth of 1 percent, who make more than $2 million annually.\nBut Farzin Barazandeh, an Occupy supporter, said the movement is about more than money.\n\"We talk a lot about 1 percent, 99 percent and division of wealth,\" he said. \"But it's something greater than that. It's about social justice.\"\nThe United Church has a committee for social justice that works to improve social and economic conditions for the underprivileged.\nsee occupy/page 3\n\"We need change,\" Barazandeh said. \"And who are the best people to stand for it? The people of faith, because they are mandated to stand for justice.\"\nPeterson, who mediated the discussion, asked attendees to \"twinkle\" their hands to show support for ideas. Vincent Gonzalez, an Occupy supporter and graduate student in religious studies at UNC Chapel Hill, supported the notion, using \"twinkle fingers\" to show understanding when people spoke, even when their ideas were different from his own.\nOne woman in attendance questioned the Occupy group's integrity and ability to abide by the law, asking why the congregation should support a group accused of lawlessness and breaking and entering, referring to the incident in November when a group of people associated with Carrboro's Anarchist Book Fair broke into the former Yates Motor building last month and distributed fliers urging people to \"Occupy Everywhere.\"\nGonzales addressed this question, making it clear that none of the members present were a part of that action. Although the Occupy Chapel Hill General Assembly ? a group meeting that conducts Occupy business based on consensus votes ? released a news release criticizing police action at the Yates dealership, it also noted that the General Assembly had not endorsed the break-in.\nSome demonstrators have been hostile with the police, Gonzalez said, and in some places, the police have been hostile with demonstrators, citing the incident at the University of California at Davis where police doused protestors with pepper spray.\nBut he said the movement has many diverse members and feelings.\n\"I want to spread the message that all of us, together, can work toward justice, even when we have orders to do otherwise,\" Gonzalez said.\nBut Pastor Richard Edens of the United Church said it's often difficult for churches to bridge the gap between charity and advocacy.\n\"It's something that doesn't come naturally,\" Edens said. \"There's a learning curve that comes with advocacy, as well as a courageous curve. \"\nIn 2007, the church adopted an economic justice covenant to govern social justice work. It describes the role of the church as a group that will stand against social injustice and strive to educate its members about the causes of poverty while taking care of those in need all over the world, not just in the Chapel Hill community.\n\"Many communitites just need to recognize what they're already doing and expand upon it,\" Eden said. \"It's a growing part of the church and we actively try to link charity and advocacy. This is a congregation where people do step forward.\"\nNo formal plans for a partnership have been established for a union between the two groups.\n \nLOAD-DATE: December 26, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\nCopyright 2011 The Durham Herald Co.\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Chapel Hill-Carrboro", "article_number": "1315", "filename": "1315Chapel Hill-Carrboro-chapelhillheralddurhamnc-05.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-14", "state": null, "version": "27", "annotators": ["SLG", "EDC"], "periodical": "chapelhillheralddurhamnc", "periodical_code": "05"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 14, "uuid": "fe92b324-6d4b-4381-b506-d4e85fe7ecc6", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 14, "uuid": "3faebcb7-2c82-46a6-ad65-8698d761c89a", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 61, "uuid": "0df414ff-8596-400d-9d66-1da9dd6fb3c3", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[175, 249, "two months since Occupy Chapel Hill first set up tents on Franklin Street,"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 192, "article_number": 7242, "uri": "urn:article:7242:4c930985-c710-4ecd-bf04-91695f447b7d", "sha256": "74c0a6b78fb3b93adb19cc66b764345c3a953d910bf1ba5b7691a30e6b835afa", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Santa Cruz city attorney sues Occupy campers for nuisance\nBy Stephen Baxter\nPosted:   11/12/2011 01:30:34 AM PST\n\n\nSANTA CRUZ -- Santa Cruz city attorneys have filed a lawsuit against Occupy Santa Cruz to cease being a public nuisance at San Lorenzo Park, where demonstrators have been camping since Oct. 8.\nJudge Timothy Volkmann is expected to rule Wednesday whether the city's injunction served Thursday will be granted to cease what deputy city attorneys calls a nuisance in the park. Deputy City Attorney Caio Arellano named Occupy Santa Cruz legal team member Steve Pleich in the suit as well as 100 John Does.\nPleich, who said he does not speak for the group, said he would help argue the group's case in court.\n\"I'm going to be defending myself to the fullest extent of the law,\" Pleich said Friday. \"We could abate the nuisance without leaving the park.\"\nDeputies served a handful of citations for lodging to the camp early Friday morning.\nMayor Ryan Coonerty said Friday that the lawsuit was filed in part because park workers and park users have complained about problems in the camp.\n\"Most of the complaints are coming from county workers who are seeing feces, drug use and other illegal activities happening,\" Coonerty said. \"They want us to take action.\"\nSanta Cruz police also reported that a camper punched a county parks worker in the face Nov. 2 after the worker's leaf blower woke him early that morning. The man was arrested on suspicion of assault, Deputy Chief Steve Clark said.\nOn Nov. 4, city officials gave Occupy leaders a permit for the demonstration, which was not requested by the demonstrators. It ordered the activists to disband the campsite by noon Wednesday and clarified other rules of the park that addressed trash, toilets and other issues.\nDozens of the city's homeless have been drawn to the park not necessarily as a political statement but because they are often not ticketed for lodging or illegal camping, authorities said.\n\"What I hear from most residents is that they overwhelmingly support the Occupy cause -- as does the City Council -- but we're just worried about the health and safety impacts on the park. Every other group in Santa Cruz who holds an event like this has a permit and has conditions, so we're just asking the same from this group,\" Coonerty said.\nThe Occupy Santa Cruz group formed as an echo of the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York that opposes national bank bailouts and economic disparities countrywide.\nCoonerty said City Council members discussed the lawsuit this week.\nVice Mayor Don Lane and other city officials have discussed the camping problems with Occupy leaders several times to try to iron out an agreement for the camp to end when the permit ends on Wednesday.\nCoonerty said city leaders are trying to avoid a \"showdown\" with Occupy campers and a forced withdrawal.\nOne rule in the permit required the demonstrators to provide three portable restrooms in parking spots on Ocean Street. There is one portable restroom there now, Pleich said.\nThe leaderless Occupy Santa Cruz \"general assembly\" has not yet decided whether to add more toilets, he said.", "metadata": {"city": "Santa Cruz", "article_number": "7242", "filename": "7242Santa Cruz-Sentinel_SantaCruz-04.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-12", "state": null, "version": "30", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "Sentinel_SantaCruz", "periodical_code": "04"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 187, "uuid": "c8e75f88-f69c-4f3a-aa2b-7c95f23c4482", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 187, "uuid": "71631a9d-2e02-4451-a483-969ef1be743c", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 929, "uuid": "4836e51c-f781-4294-ad85-182546ba8276", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[864, 914, "Deputies served a handful of citations for lodging"], [915, 948, "to the camp early Friday morning."]]}, {"id": 934, "uuid": "b25a3431-9683-4618-80f6-36b064e46f73", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[262, 307, "demonstrators have been camping since Oct. 8."]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 20, "article_number": 1386, "uri": "urn:article:1386:124966e7-2a02-4f4f-ad84-559a66af6942", "sha256": "d3e4ef36a0da249fcc9a2e29c99512637189aaf6b4a16271eaf27ecfdb926bba", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Link: http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201110190148\nOctober 28, 2011\nOccupy protesters vow to defy Charleston's request to leave\nBy Travis Crum\n\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Protesters aligned with the Occupy Wall Street movement said Friday they would defy Charleston's request to halt overnight camping at the capital city's Davis Park.\nJosh Dolin, a protester from South Charleston, said power was cut off to the park Friday evening. The protesters would not have a power supply for heaters when temperatures begin to drop to freezing this weekend, he said.\nDolin said it's an effort by the city to push the 30 or so protesters out of the park, where they have been assembled for more than two weeks.\n\"Most of us are from the mountains,\" Dolin said. \"We can rough it.\"\nCharleston mayoral assistant Rod Blackstone said the protesters were told last week their stay at the park could not be permanent.\n\"It's just not sustainable,\" he said. \"Having an encampment there for the next several months is not an option.\"\nBlackstone also said the protesters were told last week that the power would be cut off because Davis Park is not meant to be supplied with power 24 hours a day.\nHe said the city wants the protesters to stay in the park only during the day and that they leave before nightfall.\nDolin said the protesters have no plans of leaving the site and will remain there \"as long as it takes.\"\nThe protesters are assembled at the site in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street movement that started in New York City in September. Every state has had an Occupy movement, according to the movement's official website.\nProtesters across the country say they represent the \"99 percent\" of the American people suffering because of the economic policies of the wealthiest \"1 percent.\"\nThe protesters moved to Davis Park about a week ago from their previous encampment at Haddad Riverfront Park. During that time, Blackstone asked the protesters to take down their signs, as well as a blue tent structure on a Kanawha Boulevard sidewalk.\nSome protesters said they moved to Davis Park to comply with the city's request not to be at Haddad.\n\"The people here understand that it's 'united we stand, united we fall,'\" said Charles Tyson, a Charleston protester. \"If we are taken, then America will step in.\"\nTyson and Dolin said they would be arrested if police get involved. Police have been mostly supportive of Charleston's movement, Dolin said.\n\"Americans realize things are pretty messed up,\" he said. \"If you look at what's happening on Wall Street, every time someone is arrested, we grow in numbers.\"\nNationally, some protesters have been arrested in cities like Atlanta and Oakland.

If we\u2019re going to get anybody\u2019s attention, across from the Statehouse would be the place,\" said Maureen Rose-Ice, 49, of Jackson. \"The long-term goal is to be acknowledged by the people who are in control.\"\nThe two dozen protesters at the state\u2019s World War II Memorial have grievances for Trenton Mayor Tony Mack and President Obama \u2014 and lots of people in between. Some are upset about cuts to the Trenton police force. Others feel state budget cuts have harmed education. And they share the anger expressed at other camps over government bailouts on Wall Street.\nCharlene Dow Edwards, a Trenton resident who held a sign reading \"108 Trenton cops are gone.

Because it\u2019s really uncomfortable out here.\"\nSince the Occupy Wall Street protests set up shop, hundreds of smaller occupations have cropped up across the nation. The movement includes more than 1,300 groups, according to the Occupy Together website.\nBeth Leech, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said the expansion of Occupy Wall Street mirrors the civil rights movement, which spread from the Southern Leadership Council to copycat sit-ins and protests across the nation. \"You\u2019ll see replication of what\u2019s happened in one place happen in another,\" Leech said. \"These are people who are upset for a variety of reasons. They\u2019re coming out to express their frustration pretty organically.\"\n\n\nVideo: Small but dedicated group occupies Trenton In one of the many offshoots of the Occupy Wall Street protests, Trenton's War World II Memorial has been occupied by locals who say they aren't going anywhere until reforms are enacted.\n(Megan DeMarco/The Star-Ledger)\n\n\nThe protesters set up camp in Trenton on Thursday, complete with sleeping bags, signs bemoaning corporate greed and designated areas: \"administration,\" \"art,\" \"comfort\" and \"sanitation.\" About a dozen slept at the memorial Monday night, and more have shown up each day. The protesters are confident their movement will grow.\nOn Monday afternoon, about 20 people stood near the edge of West State Street, across from the Statehouse, and waved signs reading \"Honk for peace, equality and reform,\" \"99 percent want our country back,\" and \"Save the American dream.\" One out of every few drivers honked in support, drawing cheers from the occupiers, who ranged in age from 17 to 63.\nEdward Anthony Salter, 29, who helped organize the occupation, said State Police and the Department of Military and Veteran\u2019s Affairs, which oversees the World War II memorial, have been cooperative and friendly. Though arrests have marked protests in New York and Boston, there has been no tension in Trenton.\n\"We\u2019re all part of the 99 percent,\" Salter said.\n\n\nhttp://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/10/small_but_dedicated_group_make.html", "metadata": {"city": "Trenton", "article_number": "7807", "filename": "7807Trenton-TheTimesofTrenton-02.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-14", "state": null, "version": "30", "annotators": ["MB"], "periodical": "TheTimesofTrenton", "periodical_code": "02"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 201, "uuid": "b92f3756-5d4d-4c8a-9d57-238d63c05409", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 201, "uuid": "1b245e29-6322-46ac-adbe-0571c3767466", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 996, "uuid": "71c8f2ac-f23a-4685-b02b-43592093a492", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[3100, 3150, "The protesters set up camp in Trenton on Thursday,"]]}, {"id": 997, "uuid": "7ac5ce81-9b75-423f-bf70-1da7ac7420e8", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[850, 886, "no police presence at Occupy Trenton"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 76, "article_number": 3456, "uri": "urn:article:3456:e4720a4b-9186-4eda-bba9-4502782d71e2", "sha256": "1df6fbb10b8abed8dc77e68d87ce1c10f9be58c50ee1763433227f01db253a4c", "batch_name": "article", "text": "City News Service\nNo City News Service material may be republished without the express written permission of the City News Service, Inc.\nOctober 17, 2011 Monday 9:57 PM PST\nLENGTH: 2463 words\nDATELINE: LOS ANGELES\n\n\nLONG BEACH (CNS) - Two people were arrested and two others were cited at a weekend Occupy Long Beach demonstration, police said today,\nBetween 30 and 45 people took part peacefully in Sunday's demonstration in Lincoln Park at Broadway and Pacific Avenue, said Long Beach police Sgt.

Teach-ins at City\nHall, referendum petition drives and the occupation of neighborhoods and\nforeclosed properties are just some of the ideas being considered as the next\nphase of action.\n\"I'm hoping it's not necessary to put down tents again,\" said Jasper Gregory, a\nmember of Occupy Oakland. \"I hope that people can organize and come together for\na meeting without having to have people down there all the time. If we have to\nhave that encampment, then this can be stopped.\"\nScott Rossi, 31, a member of Occupy San Francisco, agreed, saying, \"We can't\nrely on the camps to always be a permanent fixture.\n\"So I think it's time to start thinking of the camps as the dot at the bottom of\nan exclamation point, and the rest of the movement as the upstroke. It's time to\ndraw that line.\"\nThough the protest began over economic disparity and corporate influence in\ngovernment, Occupy Wall Street has seen much of the media coverage in the past\nmonth focus on clashes between campers and police, with free speech rights\nstealing the spotlight as the movement's central issue. Occupy Oakland, Occupy\nSan Jose and Occupy Cal have seen their encampments forcibly removed by police,\nand many protesters have cited police brutality and infringement on their free\nspeech rights. Occupy San Francisco has received many warnings by city officials\nto disband.\n\"So we're carrying two torches right now: social economic justice and the First\nAmendment stuff,\" Rossi said. \"It's diluted the message.\"\nHenry Gage Jr., an Occupy San Jose participant, said work never stopped on the\neconomic issues, despite the shift in media attention.\n\"If battles with occupiers and the police fall to the background, more of the\nreal story will come out,\" Gage said. \"I think people will be pleasantly\nsurprised.\"\nDespite that, there have been clear problems with public drunkenness, hostility\nand vandalism in the camps.\nPolice crackdowns might be a blessing, many occupiers say, because even if\nencampments are permanently stymied, the energy they built can be redirected\nonto a clean slate.\nRossi said he believes the energy already generated can sustain the movement,\nespecially if organizers continue using Internet tools, such as Twitter and\nInterOccupy.org .\n\"This is the first Internet-fueled revolution we've seen,\" Rossi said.\nThere's talk about breaking the encampments into smaller, more\nneighborhood-based occupations. \"Occupy the Hood\" efforts are under way in\nOakland and other cities nationwide.\nTalk has also surfaced of shifting the movement indoors or onto private\nproperty.\nOccupy Oakland members voted days after their eviction from Frank H. Ogawa Plaza\non Monday to move to Henry J. Kaiser park, across from the Fox Theater. Many\nprotesters see it as a logical step to focus on occupying foreclosed properties.\n\"I'm sure that can be fairly successful in the suburbs,\" Rossi said, suggesting\nan emphasis on getting families back into their foreclosed homes.\nThe first example of a foreclosure occupation was the short-lived mob takeover\nof a foreclosed downtown building in Oakland that once housed a homeless\nservices center.\n\"That example was poorly planned and poorly thought-out, which is why it\ncollapsed,\" Rossi said.\nShould the movement's focus turn to foreclosures, the police response will be\neven more complex, said interim Oakland police Chief Howard Jordan.\n\"If they go into a foreclosed home, we have to get the banks or whoever owns the\nproperty to agree they don't want them there,\" Jordan said. \"If they're in an\nopen lot, we still have to get owners' permission to remove them. When it's on\npublic property, by comparison, we have a clear reason to arrest them.\"\nThat distinction opens the door, some occupiers say, to better engaging the\nmiddle class.\n\"I think the important thing on this is they have the support of the community,\"\nGregory said. \"I think if they take these actions, people need to canvass the\nneighborhood. We have to knock on doors and say, 'This woman who was your\nneighbor, we're moving her back in. Are you OK with that?' You have to get the\ngood will of the neighbors. That's vital, crucial to making this work.\"\nEven if forced occupations fail, other options abound, Gage said. He said he has\nalready seen people in San Jose parking their cars in public with tents set up\non the vehicles' roofs as a signal of solidarity, and he foresees regular\nteach-ins and ballot campaigns surviving the demise of encampments.\nBut many occupiers and observers say the encampments remain a critical part of\nthe movement.\n\"I've got friends who think this is a disaster, that police have been successful\nin evicting camps, that they're going to neuter the movement because it has lost\nthe one thing they had which was predictable: a visible presence,\" said Robert\nBulman, a sociology professor at Saint Mary's College in Moraga.\nAs encampments across the nation become fewer, can the movement survive beyond\nthe tents?\n\"That's the challenge,\" Gregory said. \"If you do pull up stakes, how do you make\nsure people come back and participate?\"\n\n\nStaff writer Scott Johnson contributed to this report.

By midday, eight of protesters had bonded out of jail and returned to their camp.\nSeveral of those arrested described police officers and special tactical units descending upon the small park beginning around 1:30 a.m. to take the 10 protesters into custody. Three protesters told The Associated Press that seven of those arrested were pepper-sprayed, and that police used force in some cases including one officer putting his knee in the back of one protester who was already face-down on the ground.\nTulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan said he received no reports that officers used unreasonable force, and said his officers pepper-sprayed only five of the 10 arrested.\n\"First of all, the arrests had nothing to do with the movement,\" Jordan said at a news conference Wednesday. \"They had to do with a violation of Tulsa ordinances and laws.\n\"Just so you know, many of the protesters who were there were free to assemble and protest on the sidewalk without being in the park after curfew,\" Jordan said.\nH.A. Chapman Centennial Green, like all city parks, has an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew that officials decided on Tuesday to begin enforcing.\nJordan said the police department supported the movement's right to lawfully and peacefully assemble, and would even protect the group if they came under threats.\nSeveral of those who bonded out of the county jail and returned to the park Wednesday felt differently.\n\"They came out to do us harm, they came out it seems to do us violence. You don't need 50 officers for this,\" said Eli Silva, 23, of Tulsa, who had been arrested. Silva said he was blinded for about an hour by the pepper spray that left an orange stain on his white hoodie, and he said he was keeping it on \"as a badge of honor.\"\n\nSamuel Molik, 24, of Tulsa, said he was arrested when a group of the protesters formed a circle in the park, interlocking their arms.\n\"It's a hard feeling to describe, it's still so fresh. I'm disappointed. I'm slightly disgusted by what's happened here,\" he said.\nAmanda Hammack, 29, of Tulsa bore several cuts and a large bruise that she said were caused by zip ties used to handcuff her.\n\"I just went limp, I didn't fight.

Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle\n\n\nOAKLAND -- Dozens of new tents sprang up outside Oakland City Hall on Friday, a sight that encouraged some Occupy Wall Street supporters but infuriated others, who expressed frustration at the city's about-face on the encampment.\nIn a matter of weeks, Oakland has welcomed campers at Frank Ogawa Plaza, warned them to leave, forcibly removed them, blocked their return and then allowed them to retake the grounds.\n\"It seems like every other day has a new set of rules,\" said Greg McConnell, president of the Jobs and Housing Coalition, which represents the city's largest companies.\nAsked about the mixed messages, Mayor Jean Quan said Friday she feels the city has been clear. \"We're being pretty consistent,\" she said. \"We're asking them not to camp.\" A day earlier, Quan was booed away by protesters when she tried to make a speech.\nOn Friday, interim Police Chief Howard Jordan explained the latest rule: Police will not enter the camp unless there is a call for service.\nBy Friday evening, the rag-tag conglomeration at the plaza had grown from a few tents in the morning to about 60, and the lawn was covered almost as completely as it had been before Tuesday morning's police raid cleared the camp. At 9 p.m., campers were setting up tents and building a pathway that followed the route of one in the original encampment.\nThe California Nurses Association set up a tent in one corner near the impromptu day care center, and a small kitchen was again serving the homeless and other campers.\nImpact on business\nNearby, small merchants complained that the camp has hurt their businesses, and they fear that a \"general strike\" called by protesters for Wednesday could further discourage customers. Meanwhile, big companies said the street protests affected their daily operations, and some Oakland residents said they were worried that police, busy with protesters, are even less able to respond to crimes in their neighborhoods.\nWhat business owners said they fear is that the camp will devolve into chaos again, something some said has already begun.\nThe owner of Sankofa African Arts and Jewelry said that on the two mornings since protesters returned, her front doorway has reeked of urine.\nShe said her business has declined by 80 percent since Occupy Oakland began.\n\"I really, really want them to leave,\" said the owner, who gave only her first name, Ellen. She has owned her business for 17 years. \"What they are doing is making business worse.\"\nA camp supporter overheard her lament and shouted: \"You would have lost your business anyway with the way the economy is going.\"\nEllen burst into tears.\nMoji Ghafouri said business has gone down 25 percent at her Caffe Teatro. Protesters also smashed one of her windows.\n\"I'm a small business,\" she said. \"If you're against corporations or big business, I'm not them.\"\nGhafouri said part of the problem is City Hall's doublespeak - like banning people from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. and then letting people camp overnight anyway.\n\"If they're not going to enforce it, don't say it,\" she said.\nWiljago Cook, 33, who set up her tent Friday, said the problems at the camp are endemic to downtown Oakland.\nBecause of Occupy Oakland, she said, \"a lot of things that happen in Oakland have been brought to light.\"\nOccupy Oakland is the latest demonstration to affect downtown businesses. At two 2010 demonstrations to protest the killing of unarmed BART passenger Oscar Grant, many downtown businesses shut early. A March 2010 protest against higher education cuts closed Interstate 880 during the evening rush hour when marchers moved to the freeway.\nOn Tuesday, the city advised business owners to ask employees to come in late because of the planned raid of the Occupy camp.\n\"If there's a protest every six months, nobody is going to come downtown,\" said a property owner in the area who works closely with business groups.\nFar from downtown, other Oaklanders see the protests as taking up too much of the city's resources in a time when there are already too few. Parks, recreation centers, senior centers and police have all been cut in recent years.\nLarry Benson, 54, has been unemployed for three years, so he supports the cause. But the North Oakland resident, the chairman of his neighborhood crime council, says the camp is affecting the whole city.\n\"This mayor should never have allowed camping at Frank Ogawa Plaza,\" he said, while also criticizing Tuesday's raid and the subsequent clashes with protesters. \"It continues to cost us. We are having a rash of burglaries over here, and the police are not responding.\"\nMichael Moore ecstatic\nAs the camp grew in size Friday, filmmaker Michael Moore flew in to pump up supporters.\nAs he made his way to the front of the plaza, he was swarmed by many of the gathered 1,000 or so protesters screaming, \"We love you, Michael!\" and \"Thank you!\"\nMoore's talk was like pouring honey on the plaza. They ate it up, and he clearly enjoyed them.\n\"Occupy Oakland! Occupy everywhere! I am honored to be here!\" he yelled through a microphone.\nAs he ticked off a litany of the complaints that spawned the Occupy movement - lack of health care, economic disparity, corporate greed, joblessness, reduced wages - the crowd roared its approval.\n\"This is a leaderless movement with tens of millions of people,\" said Moore, who flew in to Oakland to address a booksellers convention. \"Weather is not going to stop us.\"", "metadata": {"city": "Oakland", "article_number": "5339", "filename": "5339Oakland-www.sfgate.com1-09.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-28", "state": null, "version": "31", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "www.sfgate.com1", "periodical_code": "09"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 141, "uuid": "59401535-0fa5-4f26-a75b-40a259a1209b", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 141, "uuid": "fc6ef41b-eb4a-449f-aaf5-9318d34ff56b", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 650, "uuid": "db3aa80c-fe91-4984-b80c-e125bc77182a", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[799, 820, "forcibly removed them"], [1632, 1679, "Tuesday morning's police raid cleared the camp."]]}, {"id": 651, "uuid": "2509b172-825e-4cb0-a606-135ffa9bde26", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 2, "offsets": [[1310, 1341, "On Friday, interim Police Chief"], [1342, 1355, "Howard Jordan"], [1356, 1448, "explained the latest rule: Police will not enter the camp unless there is a call for service"]]}, {"id": 656, "uuid": "a96627f5-8bf0-45f0-a1fc-921538e3a0bd", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[485, 550, "Dozens of new tents sprang up outside Oakland City Hall on Friday"], [1450, 1562, "By Friday evening, the rag-tag conglomeration at the plaza had grown from a few tents in the morning to about 60"], [1562, 1631, ", and the lawn was covered almost as completely as it had been before"], [1680, 1802, "At 9 p.m., campers were setting up tents and building a pathway that followed the route of one in the original encampment."], [5066, 5153, "As the camp grew in size Friday, filmmaker Michael Moore flew in to pump up supporters."], [5154, 5313, "As he made his way to the front of the plaza, he was swarmed by many of the gathered 1,000 or so protesters screaming, \"We love you, Michael!\" and \"Thank you!\""]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 78, "article_number": 3474, "uri": "urn:article:3474:87d7e823-2793-4b63-a49b-646134b77f5e", "sha256": "61ba5989b1e5244d4174aad8ef8d04b9d31038e643a45713885d4efaff98296c", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Protesters and community speak out at Lincoln Park with \u2018Occupy Long Beach\u2019\nOctober 21st, 2011 \u00b7 No Comments \u00b7 Uncategorized\n\n\n\nProtesters march across 4th Street in downtown Long Beach as part of the Occupy Long Beach movement rallies that happened on Oct. 15 and Oct. 16.\nStephanie Raygoza\nStaff Writer\n\n\nLong Beach residents and community organizers took to the streets and gathered at Lincoln Park in the city\u2019s downtown district last weekend to protest in solidarity with the Occupy Together movement. The Occupy Long Beach events culminated on Sunday with two arrests and two other citations after a number of participants came to disagreements with the police officers who attempted to usher them out of the public park.\nThe purpose of the non-violent, non-partisan movement, which continues to spread across the country, is to protest corporate greed. Following the Declaration of the Occupation of New York City document and intending to help represent the disadvantaged \u201c99 percent\u201d majority that is suffering from an unfair global economy, the hundreds of sign-wielding protestors chanted and expressed their concerns over the \u201cone percent\u201d of corporate America that they believe have come to run the government.\nIn light of the New York City General Assembly occupying Wall Street in Liberty Square, more than 250 students, community advocates and educators occupied and rallied in the city\u2019s financial district Saturday morning. The crowd then marched to Lincoln Park for the general assembly that continued well into Sunday, as people began setting up temporary shelters at night.\nIn a press release sent to the Signal Tribune by event coordinators, local organizer Tammara Phillips echoed the event\u2019s purpose and said, \u201cWe are a grassroots, local movement in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street\u2026we are the 99 percent.\u201d Cal State Long Beach student and organizer Ben Fisher attended the protests and said he had worked closely with the City beforehand to ensure that participation in the movement was as transparent as possible.\nStill, Fisher said that he and the other organizers never received the proper cooperation and partnership from the City, and in an email sent to several news outlets on Oct. 17, he described many instances throughout the evening when police officials would harass protesters over the manner in which they could occupy the park.\n\u201cBefore sundown, the City set up three sets of floodlights running on loud portable generators,\u201d Fisher wrote in the email. \u201cBetween the brightness of the lights, the droning of the generators, and constant harassment by the LBPD, Occupy Long Beach was up all night.\u201d\nIn a press release recapping Saturday\u2019s events, the Long Beach Police Department (LBPD) characterized the demonstration as a display of mutual respect between police and the demonstrating community with demonstrators able to express their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech while obeying all applicable laws.\nThe LBPD issued another press release on Oct. 17 to illustrate the outcome of Sunday\u2019s demonstration. Police officials said that as the night neared 10pm, the hour in which the park closed, the group grew to approximately 75 in attendance and were warned to disperse. Most subjects proceeded to exit the park and move onto the sidewalk, however police officials made the decision to arrest 30-year-old Jason James and a minor for failing to comply with the request to vacate the park.\nAccording to the press release, the group chanted and yelled in defiance of police while they searched other tents in the park.

The first one, last Saturday in the rain, marked the start of Occupation Sebastopol in solidarity with a nearly two-month-old demonstration in New York\u2019s Wall Street area protesting the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of corporations and the nation\u2019s wealthiest one percent.\nThough only a few people have been staying the night in three or four tents erected in the northeast corner of the Sebastopol plaza, the city has alerted Occupy supporters that staying there violates city ordinance.\nThey were given a 20-page permit application Wednesday evening that\u2019s supposed to be completed by Tuesday, several members said.\nBut it\u2019s not at all clear what the consensus for handling the city\u2019s demand will be.\nAs part of the cross-pollination that\u2019s occurring between demonstrators in different cities, Ben Browner, an Occupy Santa Rosa participant who helped negotiate a permit obtained last week for camping at Santa Rosa City Hall, urged his Sebastopol counterparts to make a good faith effort to meet the Tuesday deadline and avoid forcing the council\u2019s hand on enforcing the ordinance.\nOccupy Sebastopol members are to hold a general assembly meeting today Sunday to discuss how to proceed.\nOne supporter, Chris Rockwell, 33, said it makes no sense for an individual to accept responsibility and liability for the entire group by taking out the permit in his or her name.\nRockwell said he\u2019s working to get the group incorporated so the permit can be obtained by the corporate entity \u2014 though that would require additional time and the patience of the city council, he said.\nRockwell said the group, meanwhile, was trying to be respectful in its use of the plaza, prohibiting alcohol, for example, and planning Sunday to move the tents to another portion of the square to spare the grass excess wear.\nOhlsen, who owns a local permaculture consulting and sustainable landscaping business, plans to hold ecological base camp design training in Sebastopol on Tuesday for Occupy supporters.\n\u201cOur intent is to work with the city in as cooperative a way as we can,\u201d said Sebastopol resident Linus Lancaster, a Healdsburg High School art teacher and Navy veteran who has supported Occupy encampments in Santa Rosa and Sebastopol.\nLancaster said he joined the Occupy Wall Street movement \u201cbecause it\u2019s the first political movement I\u2019ve seen that in broad terms understands the issues America is facing in a systemic way.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for the revolution for four years,\u201d 88-year-old Geneva Folsom said. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been passionate about getting out and fighting for something.\u201d\nThe marching, chanting and camping out is just the beginning of a process aimed at raising awareness, engaging large numbers and reaching consensus on common goals, demonstrators said.\nIn Santa Rosa, junior college business student Frank Anderson, 19, said he\u2019d camped out at Santa Rosa City Hall for nearly a month and now thinks of it as home.\nWhen the lease on his apartment is up Jan. 21, he plans to give it up altogether since he\u2019s living out front of City Hall to support the occupation.\n\u201cWhen this goes down in the history books,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s going to go right next to the Civil Rights movement.\u201d\nhttp://www.watchsonomacounty.com/2011/11/cities/occupy-sebastopol-seeks-support-protests-big-banks/", "metadata": {"city": "Sebastopol", "article_number": "7504", "filename": "7504Sebastopol-WatchSonomaCounty-03.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-13", "state": null, "version": "30", "annotators": ["EN"], "periodical": "WatchSonomaCounty", "periodical_code": "03"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 195, "uuid": "6dabdbce-87e9-4759-b12f-a2d6d24b398c", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 195, "uuid": "1bd3c39e-8132-413a-87da-99afcaef7ddc", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 971, "uuid": "c9a1e691-6ab9-4456-b2f6-188f70dde5e3", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[142, 240, "Occupy Sebastopol demonstrators put their voices, and their feet, behind the movement on Saturday."], [241, 343, "Tim Ryan, 23, of the west county, protests with Occupy Sebastopol on Saturday outside Wells Fargo Bank"], [1152, 1473, "The march passed the branches of several national banks, where supporters pumped their fists and chanted their dissatisfaction with traditional financial institutions.

As seen Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2011, the plywood wall has already attracted its share of graffiti. (Dakota Smith/Los Angeles Daily News)\n\n\nLOS ANGELES -- The city Department of General Services barricaded a fountain and a memorial sculpture in front of City Hall to protect them from damage by people camped on the lawn for Occupy L.A., which turns one month old today.\nThe Frank Putnam Flint Fountain was built in 1933 in honor of the senator's efforts to bring water to Los Angeles. A firefighters' memorial on the southwest corner of the City Hall lawn was built in 1944 to honor fire personnel killed in the line of duty.\nThe structures had sustained some non-permanent graffiti, mayoral spokesman Peter Sanders said. At least one protester had been spotted periodically sitting on top of the fountain, and protesters had also hung a movie screen from the fountain to project videos.\nConstruction of a nearly 20-foot-high wooden structure began about 4 this morning, demonstrators said, and took about six hours to complete.\nCity officials told the campers they were free to use the structure as a canvas for art work, said Keaton Yale, who joined Occupy L.A. a few days ago, and a number of people immediately started spray-painting it with graffiti-style writings and graphics.\nSomeone sprayed a large, colorful \"Power to the People\" on the west side of the structure surrounding the fountain.\nYale described the markings as less than attractive.\n\"It's all art, but it's not necessarily pleasing art,\" Yale said, adding that he hoped attendees at the movement's general assembly meeting tonight would take up the issue of selecting an artist to paint something \"beautiful\" on the structure. He said he was concerned the graffiti would upset people driving around City Hall and discredit the Occupy movement.\n\"There's a lot of good here, but there's some people here that don't know why they're here,\" Yale said. \"If stuff gets too crazy, I'm probably going to find a better organized thing.\"\nOccupy L.A. began Oct. 1 when protesters set up about 40 tents  on the north side of City Hall in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street. The demonstrations, which have spread nationwide, have sought to highlight what protesters call a widening gap between rich and poor.\nOccupy L.A. has since grown about tenfold. Los Angeles police this morning counted about 475 tents on the 1.7-acre city park surrounding City Hall.\nThe much-smaller Occupy San Fernando Valley movement, which began on Saturday, continues in the courtyard of Van Nuys Civic Center. But unlike the downtown version, the Valley protesters are forbidden to camp overnight at the site.\nAbout 8-10 people show up daily at the Van Nuys Civic Center, said LAPD Captain Tia Morris. The group leaves by 7 p.m. \"Then they go to Van Nuys Boulevard and wave their signs and march,\" said Morris.", "metadata": {"city": "LosAngeles", "article_number": "3930", "filename": "3930LosAngeles-LosAngelesDailyNews-03.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-01", "state": null, "version": "29", "annotators": ["CD"], "periodical": "LosAngelesDailyNews", "periodical_code": "03"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 92, "uuid": "8c590467-7407-4b08-846d-233beefa6a98", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 92, "uuid": "8956dc79-e260-4d71-8acd-20928f124678", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 407, "uuid": "aabb017a-62f8-483a-968c-f050c1161be5", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[606, 681, "people camped on the lawn for Occupy L.A., which turns one month old today."], [2310, 2404, "Occupy L.A. began Oct. 1 when protesters set up about 40 tents  on the north side of City Hall"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 142, "article_number": 5222, "uri": "urn:article:5222:7f0bc3fc-6406-49de-ad8d-7ab938e7722a", "sha256": "b73a19503faa9f3936e81ff55103179e3d1f341e46f2f637cd56d255dc5c0b14", "batch_name": "article", "text": "358 of 392 DOCUMENTS\nContra Costa Times (California)\nDecember 13, 2011 Tuesday\nOccupy tree-sitters come down from perch outside Oakland City Hall\nBYLINE: By Harry Harris Oakland Tribune\nSECTION: BREAKING; My Town; Alameda; News; Local\nLENGTH: 154 words\n\n\nMore than a month after taking up a perch in a sycamore at Frank H.

Jackson, after the victim reported the assault to Occupy organizers, they pressured the suspect to leave the scene immediately. The assault was reported to police and there are activists at the camp on hand to talk about sexual assault resources\u2014they're wearing pink armbands.\nThe protest so far has been surprisingly safe and violence free\u2014this terrible allegation certainly casts a shadow over the encampment. Amid all the friendship and excitement, keep on your guard, everyone.\nHere's the report the police sent out last night:\nThe Portland Police Bureau is investigating an allegation of a sexual assault that occurred last night in Chapman Square where \"Occupy Portland\" supporters are camping.\nLast night, at 11:15 p.m., Portland Police officers assigned to Central Precinct were flagged down at Southwest 5th and Main by representatives from \"Occupy Portland.\" The representatives told the officers that a sexual assault may have occurred inside Chapman Square. Officers learned that a female in a tent at Chapman Square may have been sexually assaulted but that she was not willing to be identified. It is not known at this time if the victim is an adult or a juvenile.\nOfficers worked with representatives from \"Occupy Portland\" throughout the day to identify the victim and to determine if a sexual assault actually happened. At this point, the information has been documented but no victim has been identified and the allegation has not been substantiated.\nThe Portland Police Bureau has advised representatives from \"Occupy Portland\" to monitor activity at the park closely and immediately report any criminal activity.\nNearly two dozen officers will continue to monitor Chapman Square and the surrounding area throughout the weekend.\nAnyone with information about this possible sexual assault is encouraged to contact Sgt. Ken Whattam at (503) 823-0242\nUPDATE: Writer Lauren Hudgins has this frustrating account of trying to get more info about the assault.\nI am furious and concerned. Tonight at around 6pm, I went down to the camp to see what progress on sexual assault response had been accomplished since Friday night. I inquired at Info about the sexual assault advocacy group. Info told me to talk to Safety (right next to them). Safety told me to talk to Info. When I complained that Info had just told me to talk to them, they told me to talk to Medical. Medical told me to look for anyone in a pink armband. I had already been looking for them and hadn't found a single one. Then someone at Medical took down my name and information so that someone who could answer my questions could get back to me eventually. This is not an acceptable response. Every single person at Info, Safety, and Medical should know how to immediately contact someone in the sexual assault advocacy team. What if I had been a victim of sexual assault and wanted to talk to someone? I would have gotten the run around. Someone could say that if this had been an actual case of sexual assault I would have been given more attention. But a victim shouldn't have to reveal to Info, Safety, and Medical (all represented by males at that time) that s/he had been sexually assaulted in order to access help. Medical reminded me that the pink armbands had been working really hard and been doing wonderful work. I absolutely have faith that they are. The problem is that there is no system to connect with them. It doesn't seem to me that there has been much progress since Friday night. When I complained that more should be done to make people safe and there should be more of a conversation about sexual assault at Occupy Portland, I was constantly met with the apology \"Sorry, but we were so preoccupied with the Portland Marathon.\"\n\n\nhttp://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2011/10/09/sexual-assault-reported-at-occupy-portland-camp", "metadata": {"city": "Portland", "article_number": "6196", "filename": "6196Portland, OR-ThePortlandMercury-07.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-09", "state": "OR", "version": "30", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "ThePortlandMercury", "periodical_code": "07"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 159, "uuid": "357a9858-c0a8-4a3c-865a-97b145677b1f", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 159, "uuid": "d890c6d4-d46e-44e1-ad3d-a444f172b473", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 766, "uuid": "0c163a44-d5fb-4d02-a02c-94a1b685845e", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[1886, 2000, "Nearly two dozen officers will continue to monitor Chapman Square and the surrounding area throughout the weekend."]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 178, "article_number": 696, "uri": "urn:article:696:249c5fd7-59b3-4479-9830-e1c34e5ad222", "sha256": "ad668ba92d4fe071cd470db53fea8d436d4d32e05337172f6eafd69f1c7a9f91", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Occupy Austin protests cost taxpayers thousands\nby STEVE ALBERTS / KVUE News\nNovember 7, 2011 at 5:40 PM\n\n\nAUSTIN -- It has been almost five weeks since Occupy Austin protesters took up residence outside Austin City Hall.\nOn Monday, KVUE News learned just how much the protest is costing taxpayers.\nSince Oct. 6, an average four to eight officers have been assigned to the Occupy Austin protest for 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Officers have been pulled off of their beats and are working overtime at a cost of more than a quarter of a million dollars.\nSince the beginning of the protest, it has cost taxpayers more than $207,000.

Since his blunder, police in other cities have shocked the nation by wantonly pepper-spraying protesters. By comparison, Tennessee\u2019s troopers were teddy bears. Some of those zip-ties went on too tight, but that\u2019s about as brutal as it got. Still, Haslam came across as a mean-spirited dolt.

Andrew Cuomo, New York raised its top tax rate on single filers making $1 million and joint filers making $2 million, a rate just slightly under the 2008 income tax surcharge that expires Dec. 31.\nEarlier this month in California, Gov. Jerry Brown said he, too, wants to avoid further cuts to education and social services by proposing a ballot initiative asking voters to increase taxes. That could hit Californians making over $250,000.\n\"Occupy turned the political conversation on its head,\" said Richard Brodsky, a senior fellow at the Wagner School at New York University. \"Time was austerity and tax cuts were the only acceptable place to be. Now, income inequality and the 99 percent dominate practical politics. OWS paved the way; Cuomo and Brown seized the moment.\"\nThere's no evidence of a national groundswell after more than a dozen states tapped their well-heeled residents for temporary income tax hikes from 2006-2009. But while most of those states let their temporary tax increases lapse as scheduled, New York and California this month went back to the well.\nDespite the political rhetoric, there's less need in either state to act to make their tax brackets more fair. California and New York already have more progressive systems than most states, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation based in Washington, D.C.\n\"California and New York are historically not going to be the most fiscally conservative states,\" said Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation. \"To say they reflect the overall country's attitude to taxing the wealthy at a disproportionate rate, that might be tenuous.\"\nCalifornia and New York are also among only four states, with Washington and Missouri, to show deficits in a midyear survey by the National Conference of Legislatures, said the group's Mandy Rafool.\nCalifornia faces a $3.7 billion shortfall for the current fiscal year and projected $12.8 billion deficit in 2013. New York learned of an unexpected $350 million deficit this year, and a higher projected deficit for the 2012-13 fiscal year of $3.5 billion.\nBut Rafool said there's no inkling more states will follow California and New York, although tax revenues are growing only slowly in most states.\n\"It's an election year and we're seeing that revenues are recovering, spending is stable,\" Rafool said. \"This is better than in the last four years. It's still not good, but it's better.\"\nShe said she'd be surprised if other states follow New York and California.\nInstead, the common thread is that each state's finances are worse than most other states, and their Democratic leadership has felt pressure from the Occupy Wall Street movement and other progressives.\nIn New York, an Occupy Albany movement has camped outside the Capitol all fall. At first, Cuomo, a Democrat who ran as a fiscal conservative last year, tried to evict them, only to be stymied by local Democratic district attorney and mayor. Occupy Albany called Cuomo \"Gov. 1 Percent\" for opposing a millionaire tax and saying it would drive employers out of state.\nMeanwhile the Democratic Party that Cuomo heads and his progressive allies continued to push for a new millionaire tax to avoid more cuts to education and health care.\nIn November, Cuomo made a hard left and pushed for the millionaire tax increase passed Wednesday that includes a modest, but rare middle class tax break. The package also provided more spending for jobs programs.\n\"My job as governor is to make the best decision at the time to meet the needs of the state at the time,\" Cuomo said Wednesday.\n\"You're seeing it play out on college campuses,\" said the California state Senate's Democratic leader, Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento. \"You're seeing it play out in different communities throughout California. There's a real sense that the pendulum in terms of the way we've had to deal with these budget deficits, has gone too far.\"\nBut while there may be an immediate payoff in cash and politics, the long-term wisdom of soaking the rich has long been questioned.\n\"As many states face increasingly large budget shortfalls that are often related to economic cycles, leaning on high-income earners and small businesses to pick up a disproportionate amount of the bill raises serious equity concerns and is bad for government revenue stability,\" said Scott Drenkard, an analyst with the Tax Foundation.\nHe notes many businesses, 94 percent of which file as individuals, and high-income earners have the most volatile income. If the economy continues to slip, they will have less revenue and that could further hurt businesses or prompt them to flee.\nNew York and California already share another distinction: They have experienced some of the greatest flight of taxpayers from 1999 to 2009 and have tax structures considered among the least attractive to businesses, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\"It reminds me of the Bob Dylan song, you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing,\" said Doug Muzzio, a Baruch College politics professor in New York City. He said continuing fiscal crisis and the Occupy Wall Street could force the same consideration elsewhere.\n\"Without any real evidence except for what I've seen here, I would think that the other states almost invariably will have to examine it,\" he said.\nAssociated Press writer Judy Lin contributed to this report from Sacramento, and AP writer Michael Virtanen contributed from Albany.\n \nLOAD-DATE: December 11, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newswire\nCopyright 2011 Associated Press\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Albany", "article_number": "11", "filename": "11Albany, NY-theassociatedpress-10.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-10", "state": "NY", "version": "23", "annotators": ["SLG", "MB"], "periodical": "theassociatedpress", "periodical_code": "10"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 11, "uuid": "70069557-e7dd-4efd-ad71-27dce3a6a105", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 11, "uuid": "de0f2f00-d70c-4626-ad65-eea037bb4fd2", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 46, "uuid": "d99d160a-d211-46bc-96e7-e85668ff2719", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[3185, 3248, "Occupy Albany movement has camped outside the Capitol all fall."]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 124, "article_number": 4766, "uri": "urn:article:4766:a0c46ebd-6bd7-434d-8299-7bb549340783", "sha256": "fae1b0e7e42241296c71bf9e180c311310019c82d63995da396b164917c07fb9", "batch_name": "article", "text": "12/25/2011 03:55 PM\nOccupy Wall Street Marks 100th Day Of Protest With Christmas Celebration\nBy: NY1 News\n\n\nOn its 100th day of protest, the Occupy Wall Street movement marked the Christmas holiday Sunday.\nHowever initial turnout was light.\nOnly about a dozen OWS participants gathered in Zuccotti Park to attend an interfaith gathering Sunday afternoon that included poetry and a potluck meal.\nProtesters tied their message to the holiday.\n\"Christmas in a lot of ways defines a lot of the problems that we're facing,\" said one protester. \"It's a very isolating time for people, especially this year when people have had homes forclosed and lost their jobs and all that sort of stuff.\"\n\"Focus on giving, focus on family, focus on friends,\" said another protester when asked what Christmas means to him. \"Think beyond the money and all the good toys, and just remember that we're people and we need to think about each other first.\"\nWhile attendance at the day's early events was sparse, protesters said they expected more people to participate in the evening's planned activities, which were scheduled to include a communion, storytelling and music.", "metadata": {"city": "NewYork", "article_number": "4766", "filename": "4766NewYork-www.ny1.com-11.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-25", "state": null, "version": "31", "annotators": ["SLG"], "periodical": "www.ny1.com", "periodical_code": "11"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 124, "uuid": "81e8efb8-2d3a-4cfc-b4b4-838ae72793f6", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 124, "uuid": "fba3b49e-1b8e-4324-8884-1497aee236ac", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 571, "uuid": "4ec19bb7-8d29-49de-9a55-0e28f8650994", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[108, 135, "On its 100th day of protest"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 7, "article_number": 1129, "uri": "urn:article:1129:09033df6-75f6-4e03-88b5-d28de7adafbc", "sha256": "0e866f77600ab71fae67c7fd7271c23ec6b0569a8fe95d02a1763621cca32233", "batch_name": "article", "text": "13 of 14 DOCUMENTS\nLowell Sun (Massachusetts)\nOctober 25, 2011 Tuesday\nArresting peaceful protesters is a disgrace\nBYLINE: The Lowell Sun\nSECTION: LETTER TO THE EDITOR; Editorials\nLENGTH: 264 words\n \nHas anyone noticed if Boston Mayor Thomas Menino has been wearing a red coat lately? Menino supported the arrests of 141 Occupy Boston protesters for reportedly harming some grass on the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway.

However, in N.H., revolution is not only a right of the people, but a duty of the people to reform government when necessary. The N.H. Constitution states: \"The doctrine of nonresistance against arbitrary power, and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.\"\nMayor Menino needs to make a public apology to the people for his treasonous words.

his account.\nHe said he has been planning on closing his bank account since he saw the increased debit card rates six months ago.\nHe walked out, cut his then-unusable card in front of his old bank

resignation letter to the state government four weeks ago and officially resigned Wednesday after 22 years as an engineer.\n\"I believe professionalism and corporatism are corrupted at every level,\" he said.\nHe would not say which government agency employed him.\nContractors who worked with his state government agency, he said, went against regulations, specifications and standards of the government.\nThe state gave $200,000 to a contractor who didn't deserve the money on a project Diaz was working on, he said.\n\"The shift I have seen since a year ago is about cutting the agencies and shift the money and resources to the private sector by mandate of Rick Scott,\" he said.\nDiaz said he didn't want to quit initially.\n\"My integrity was constantly being pinched, and I couldn't stand it anymore,\" he said.\nDiaz said he heard about Occupy Gainesville over the Internet.\nAnother protester, Eddy Arenas, 32, said he found about the Occupy Wall Street movement from videos on the Internet.\n\"We have a personal responsibility,\" he said. \"We can't just keep pointing fingers at the ruling elite ... we put ourselves in this position.\"\nArenas said he understands the Gainesville Police Department has city ordinances to follow when the time comes, and he appreciates how cooperative the GPD has been.\n\"The most important thing we are getting from this is the connections we've made from so many great people who care about fixing the problems that affect this world,\" he said.\nUF students are joining the occupation movement across all college campuses.\nSkye Schmelzer, sophomore psychology major, organized Occupy UF along with two other students.\nSchmelzer also got UF included in the Occupy Florida Colleges coalition.\n\"People are pissed off and they are taking a stand,\" she said.\nAt time of publication, Occupy Gainesville had a permit that allowed protesters to stay overnight at the plaza Wednesday night.\nOccupy Gainesville's general assembly decided to fulfill the permit, said Maya Garner, a protester.\nSince the general assembly fulfilled the permit, it has forfeited its ability to reapply and receive a longer permit, she said.\n\"The general assembly will decide tomorrow evening if they will stay Thursday night,\" Garner said. \"If they decide to stay in the park tomorrow night, it will be in civil disobedience.\"\nOccupy UF will have its first meeting at 5 p.m. Thursday at Turlington Plaza to organize.\nLink:

All there for different reasons, but all, apparently, with a common sense that many things in the country are broken, and need to be fixed.\nThe with the ongoing protest that originally started last month in New York as a critique of the financial sector's role in the meltdown of the world economy in 2008.\nSome of the protestors said they intended to stay indefinitely as a show of support for the cause.\nThey claimed a section in the east side of the park with tables, chairs, signs and at least 15 tents to mark their territory. Earlier in the day, the police changed their tune by saying they would not attempt to push protestors out of the park when it closed at 11 p.m.\nStill, the group will have to solve some basic needs, such as bathrooms, cooking, warmth and safety, if they are to succeed with a lengthy occupation. People had been stopping by throughout the evening with bags of groceries, baked goods and other supplies, said Shay O'Reilly, a recent UI graduate.\n\"As long as it takes,\" Hannah Staley, 19, a University of Iowa sophomore, said of how long she plans to stay. \"I personally am here because I am tired of how things are, and it will be worth the effort of figuring out what it takes to stay out here.\"\nBoyfriend and girlfriend, Ricardo Mantilla and Misty Rebik, of Iowa City, were one pair who said they planned on staying on together as long as it takes to get congress and the president to respond to the movement's message.\n\"End the tax breaks for the corporations and use that money to rebuild our infrastructure,\" said Mantilla.\nRebik agreed, iPhone in hand, sitting next to the red tent where she was planning on spending the night.\n\"We don't have a debt problem in this country, we have a revenue problem,\" she said. \"I don't necessarily have a problem with a fair, equivalent tax rate for everyone, but the fact is that things aren't fair right now.\"\nLate night, the crowd was subdued.\nBy midnight, around 50 people were settled in for the night. Some had gone to sleep, and others huddled around the park's gazebo, occassionally fielding questions from intoxicated students walking through.\n\"The way the economy has been handled, the way the bailouts have been handled,\" Jared Krauss, 21, a University of Iowa junior answered two people who identified themselves as college students as to why he is protesting. \"We are paying for tuition for college, and there are supposed to be jobs there for us, and they're not there.\"\nThe protest itself was civil, at least the early goings. The movement is leaderless, and decisions about the occupation were made through majority decisions at a general assembly at the center of the park, with the crowd amplifying each speaker's suggestion by repeating what they just said, with each decision receiving approval or disapproval through a smattering of hand signals.\nAnd the decisions, for a movement that has been portrayed by some national media outlets as either ineffectual or dangerous, were exeedingly polite. Alcohol and drugs were prohibited by group fiat ; the protest mission statement was left intentionally vague to welcome people of varying political beliefs; the city and the police were recognized for allowing the protest to peacebly occur ; and groups were established to provide food to those who stayed and clean up after they have gone, down to the last cigarette butt.\nClarence Johnson, a database administrator from Iowa City who attended the event, said it might appear from the outside like the movement has no clear goals, but that this is in fact intentional. He said that since the movement already brought together hundreds of people to talk about the nation's problems already fulfills a part of its purpose.\n\"If they had a list of demands, or a leadership structure, this would allow people to automatically prescreen themselves out because of the one part of it they don't agree with,\" Johnson said. \"Regardless of where you stand on the political spectrum, we can all agree that there are real issues that need to be dealt with.\"", "metadata": {"city": "Iowa City", "article_number": "3072", "filename": "3072Iowa City-IowaCityPatch-07.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-08", "state": null, "version": "28", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "IowaCityPatch", "periodical_code": "07"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 67, "uuid": "ec7eb4db-20a9-4403-a2f2-70d484079be0", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 67, "uuid": "b39c65a4-8d82-46f6-8b70-9688b175ce9f", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 299, "uuid": "d7754e3d-68aa-4585-b9c4-23140abb45a3", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[1771, 1894, "the police changed their tune by saying they would not attempt to push protestors out of the park when it closed at 11 p.m."]]}, {"id": 303, "uuid": "59898a63-d1b5-4a00-a88e-9eb213f1d0d9", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[100, 134, "College Green Park on Friday night"], [338, 364, "Between 200 and 300 people"], [1098, 1217, "included the employed, the underemployed, and unemployed; local politicians, college students, children and the elderly"], [1708, 1725, "at least 15 tents"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 154, "article_number": 577, "uri": "urn:article:577:ab71c1a1-30f0-4433-8549-148e396bf5d2", "sha256": "ad4a778915a7fe93c101c9139404a2172d5dffd0afa27f4e45bc892ab570ee06", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Posted: 5:55 p.m. Friday, Oct. 14, 2011\nMayor working to find Occupy Atlanta solution\nATLANTA \u2014 \n\n\nAtlanta Mayor Kasim Reed's office says he will determine the next step once his executive order allowing the Occupy Atlanta protestors to stay in Woodruff Park expires Monday night. That order gives demonstrators the ability to remain in the downtown park after 11 p.m.  Under that order, protestors must remove their tents by 5 p.m. Monday and vacate the park by 11 p.m. The office said earlier Friday that the expiration of that order was never meant to be a hard deadline, but added once that time comes, Mayor Reed will reevaluate the situation and make his final determination.\nThis comes after Occupy Atlanta 's leader, Tim Franzen, told Channel 2's Richard Elliot that they had no plans to leave the park by 11 p.m. Monday.\n \"We will be ready for non-violent civil disobedience,\" said Franzen.  \"We have commitments from specific civil rights leaders to stand here with us, to sit d own and link arms, and to be dragged off and sent to jail if that's what the mayor wants.\"\nThe city hopes to avoid the kind of violent confrontations seen in New York  City where police officers and demonstrators clashed in the streets in full view of cameras.  NYPD officers and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg came under criticism for their handling of the situation.\nFranzen told Elliot he believed Monday was a hard deadline and was determined to remain in the park past it.  Still, he invited Mayor Reed to come down and talk with the demonstrators.\n\"We'd love to have his support,\" he said.  \"We'd love to have his endorsement.  We think the voices that we're trying to lift up are the voices of his constituents.\"\nThe group marched Friday evening from the park to a homeless shelter on Peachtree and Pine streets, blocking traffic on the downtown streets.\nSome of Occupy Atlanta 's neighbors are also growing frustrated with the demonstrations, and told Elliot they would like to see the city move in and shut them down.\n \"It's really annoying,\" said Katelyn Caccavale, who lives across the street from Woodruff Park.  \"Our walls are paper thin, so every night, we hear them screaming and yelling and banging their bongos.\"\n Maryam Ahmed works downtown and said she supports the protests and the mayor's decision not to move in.\n \"I'm glad they're out here,\" she said.  \" I believe in the movement all across America.\"\n No word when the mayor will make a decision whether to extend that executive order to allow the protestors to remain.\nAs Occupy Atlanta 's occupation of Woodruff Park enters its second week, no one is exactly sure how much the demonstrations are costing Atlanta's taxpayers, though APD admits it is costing something.\nIn an emailed received by Elliot, Atlanta Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it was just too early to tell the exact expenditures.  But he confirmed it is costing taxpayers some money.\n\"There is no question that providing police presence to properly ensure public safety surrounding the Occupy Atlanta movement requires an increased expenditure of resources and funding,\" said Campos.\nBut Campos went on to say Atlanta Police are well equipped to handle this demonstration, because it has a lot of experience handling large scale events.\n\"The Atlanta Police Department routinely handles large-scale events, much larger in fact, than these protests,\" he said.\n\"On any given weekend, there are hundreds of thousands of people in the city of Atlanta for professional and collegiate sports, trade shows, conventions, festivals, and cultural and artistic events.  Before any event that requires additional APD presence, the department evaluates the resources required for the event and for city-wide coverage.  The department is performing this same evaluation regarding Occupy Atlanta and planning ahead for the indefinite duration of the protest.\"\n Campos also ensured that APD will continue to provide for public safety across the rest of the city.", "metadata": {"city": "Atlanta", "article_number": "577", "filename": "577Atlanta-Copyofwww.wsbtv.com_occupyatlanta-08.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-14", "state": null, "version": "27", "annotators": ["NBA", "SLG"], "periodical": "Copyofwww.wsbtv.com_occupyatlanta", "periodical_code": "08"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 151, "uuid": "a11546d5-9b29-4bfe-97e0-46471e5b805e", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 151, "uuid": "e0646dbe-d100-46a5-93ff-2d87bc25bad2", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 724, "uuid": "b4c4496e-9587-4f05-99b2-61f26d21a23c", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[3121, 3146, "But Campos went on to say"], [3147, 3154, "Atlanta"], [3155, 3273, "Police are well equipped to handle this demonstration, because it has a lot of experience handling large scale events."], [2921, 2925, "\"The"], [3279, 3286, "Atlanta"], [3287, 3394, "Police Department routinely handles large-scale events, much larger in fact, than these protests,\" he said."]]}, {"id": 730, "uuid": "f29e79bd-84e1-42f5-bfc3-73605380bc52", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[1711, 1852, "The group marched Friday evening from the park to a homeless shelter on Peachtree and Pine streets, blocking traffic on the downtown streets."]]}, {"id": 731, "uuid": "1aea5758-203c-4be7-9bf4-3c3d9b507085", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 2, "offsets": [[2535, 2544, "As Occupy"], [2545, 2552, "Atlanta"], [2553, 2607, "'s occupation of Woodruff Park enters its second week,"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 194, "article_number": 7371, "uri": "urn:article:7371:807313e5-4daf-417e-a39b-4f044c617449", "sha256": "9eded04be566109cb4d0dd58d98ff4ded83b0986b21f42b425af7cd542a0421f", "batch_name": "article", "text": "19 of 68 DOCUMENTS\nThe Associated Press State & Local Wire\nOctober 13, 2011 Thursday 11:38 PM GMT\nSECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL\nLENGTH: 145 words\nDATELINE: SEATTLE\n\n\nBigger Occupy Seattle protest set for Saturday\nDemonstrators took a brief break from downtown Seattle's Westlake Park on Thursday to make way for a jobs rally organized by Washington labor unions.\nKING-TV (http://bit.ly/pCQUJ80) reports about 10 police officers arrived at the park around 9:30 a.m. and told about 75 demonstrators they had to leave.

Many have since hunkered down outside the cathedral, pitching tents and setting up a makeshift kitchen, toilets and an information center. Until now, church staff members have allowed the protesters to remain. But in a statement released late Wednesday, St. Paul's said that the \"increased scale and nature\" of the camp could make it more difficult for the cathedral to stay open for worshippers and tourists.\nNEW YORK\nA plainclothes police officer who's becoming known as the \"hipster cop\" for his fashion sense says he thinks his rising profile helps \"break down a lot of walls.\" Detective Rick Lee, 45, has been the subject of much Internet chatter for showing up at Zuccotti Park for his work as a community affairs officer wearing narrow ties, cardigan sweaters and thick-framed glasses.\nRainy weather put a damper on the protests Wednesday, with demonstrators huddled under tarps. A couple of die-hards stood in the downpour holding up American flags and wearing gas masks.\nSOUTH CAROLINA\nCharleston is known for its Southern hospitality. Now it's playing host to the region's newest \"Occupy\" protests. Occupy Charleston got a permit to stay at a city park beginning Wednesday, and about 30 people showed up. The permit allows groups of up to 49 people to protest outside City Hall, banks and other locations. If the crowds were bigger, the marches would require a city parade permit.\nCALIFORNIA\nSacramento police say nine protesters associated with the Occupy Wall Street movement were arrested at downtown's Cesar Chavez Park on suspicion of being there after hours and failing to disperse. City officials had refused to grant a permit allowing them to remain in the park overnight. Laura Peck, police spokeswoman in the California capital city, said the nine were among about 100 people demonstrating; the other protesters complied with police orders to leave. Sacramento police have now arrested around 70 people.\nNORTH CAROLINA\nPolice in Asheville arrested four people for washing windows. Protester Amy Hamilton said she and nine other demonstrators were cleaning up the Merrill Lynch building when four were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of trespassing. About 200 people have participated in Asheville, a city in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina.\nOHIO\nSome demonstrators marched to a Cincinnati City Council meeting to voice concern over what they said were some leaders' apparent opposition to the protest. The group also wants the city to change its rule banning people from a downtown park after closing hours. A federal judge on Tuesday had ordered a temporary stop to the police ticketing of the protesters.\n \nLOAD-DATE: October 20, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newswire\nCopyright 2011 Associated Press\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Charleston", "article_number": "1366", "filename": "1366Charleston, SC-theassociatedpress-08.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-19", "state": "SC", "version": "27", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "theassociatedpress", "periodical_code": "08"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 18, "uuid": "f3893c85-94ea-4afc-976e-969e45a6b7d3", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 18, "uuid": "b8e0d290-8adc-4078-988e-0aa333386509", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 82, "uuid": "64b0f337-b0e6-4d66-a2da-07a2a03ab789", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[1499, 1552, "Occupy Charleston got a permit to stay at a city park"], [1553, 1604, "beginning Wednesday, and about 30 people showed up."]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 51, "article_number": 2511, "uri": "urn:article:2511:b3943405-f5bb-4217-bbd7-b6d5a406e701", "sha256": "26066e0ab72eef58109d8fd966978e2c77e4d7380ac9cc472b985496f5ed9700", "batch_name": "article", "text": "The Detroit News (Michigan)\nNovember 15, 2011 Tuesday\n1-dot Edition\nVote today may extend stay\nBYLINE: By, Josh Katzenstein and Darren A.

T here's office space on Woodward in Detroit's downtown and a warehouse and 50-unit hotel in southwest Detroit, all of which have been donated to the group.\nSome members of the group moved supplies from camp to the other locations last weekend.\nAt a general assembly meeting Monday night in Grand Circus Park, many members approved a proposal to keep the southwest Detroit location as a meeting place during the winter.\nThey pushed for that because the space wouldn't be able to double as housing for all members, Coffey said.\nThe group is exploring other housing options to keep members together - especially for members who might not have anywhere else to go, she said. \"We want to keep people involved ... so they continue organizing.\"\nHaving a presence in the city helps the movement's \"activism and mass mobilization that is going to drive the reform of America,\" said Zachary Steve, another Occupy member.\njkatzenstein@detnews.com\n(313) 222-2019\nStaff Writer Mark Hicks contributed.", "metadata": {"city": "Detroit", "article_number": "2511", "filename": "2511Detroit-thedetroitnews-07.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-15", "state": null, "version": "28", "annotators": ["CD"], "periodical": "thedetroitnews", "periodical_code": "07"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 51, "uuid": "38b0a813-f7d5-4408-840b-b1fe325f63f9", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 51, "uuid": "6ffb0a41-da6a-42b2-937b-c7fad4df40be", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 223, "uuid": "5d045f61-efa4-4a52-bacc-23dfae91b0eb", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[1606, 1639, "Deputy Police Chief James Tolbert"], [1673, 1751, "and said there were no plans for arrests or evictions when the permit expired."]]}, {"id": 226, "uuid": "fa05b408-01a9-46cd-a9e5-f95b6901e5f7", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[553, 593, "where they've been living since Oct. 14,"]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 205, "article_number": 779, "uri": "urn:article:779:fcea297a-dd31-4dc8-b29f-d5b4321f7860", "sha256": "107db2d39ca3aae0498acf4af39ffbde94e6c2dcb6bc86fd23504b5efb297792", "batch_name": "article", "text": "13 of 44 DOCUMENTS\nAustin American-Statesman (Texas)\nOctober 20, 2011 Thursday  \nFinal Edition\nSocial media helps social movement grow\nBYLINE: Andrea Ball AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF\nSECTION: MAIN; Pg. A01\nLENGTH: 1648 words\n\n\nThe show: Occupy Austin\nThe scene: Early evening on a recent weekday at Austin City Hall\nThe cast: More than 150 college kids, business owners, teachers, homeless people, waiters and so on\nThe plot: Motley crew of protesters tries to run a meeting. Chaos ensues.\nBonus plot: The whole thing unfolds on social media\nNobody said running an occupation was easy. From the gay rights movement to the Vietnam War protests, the messy task of trying to change the world has been well-documented in books, movies, scholarly papers and academic research.\nBut these days, people don't have to wait for the postgame commentary. Thanks to social media, they can watch every detail of the Wall Street protests unfold for themselves. Occupy Austin is, in a way, a reality show produced by Facebook, Twitter, Livestream, blogs, Google groups and email. And what viewers are seeing ranges from high drama and fierce divisions to hard work and unexpected kindness.\nWhether Occupy protests go boom or bust, one thing is clear: Trying to pull off a social movement is a complicated, time-consuming, often-frustrating business.\n\"It's a wonderful process,\" said Sylvia Benini , one of Occupy Austin's organizers. \"It's like the birth of a child. It has to grow.\"\nEpisode 1: Coming together\nThe scene: Late morning on a weekday at a small warehouse in East Austin\nThe cast: About a dozen volunteers, ranging in age from teens to middle-aged\nThe plot: Protesters gather at headquarters to eat, sleep and handle logistical issues.\nBase camp for Occupy Austin is a borrowed building cluttered with tools, tents, battered furniture, old computer monitors, bedding and more. A makeshift kitchen houses a sink, a counter and a mini-refrigerator. A small room at the front of the warehouse serves as the computer center, and another stores food donations.\n\"We've spent $50 on food,\" said volunteer Chris Nielsen , a 32-year-old Austin man who owns a golf cart taxi company. \"Whatever we need, we just put it out on Twitter or Facebook, and it just appears.\"\nOccupy Austin is one of hundreds of spinoffs from Occupy Wall Street, an ongoing protest in New York City that opposes, among other things, corporate money in politics and the growing wealth gap. Since the New York rallies began Sept. 17, protests have spread to more than 1,500 cities across the nation and world, including Paris and Rome .\nProtesters complain about different things, but their core belief is generally the same: Government favors the rich and oppresses the middle class and poor.\n\"It's always the little guy that gets stepped on,\" Nielsen said.\nThe Austin movement began to gel Sept. 29 , when about 500 people flocked to the coffeehouse Ruta Maya on South Congress Avenue to talk about the protests. Volunteers spent the next week planning an Oct. 6 rally at City Hall. Work groups, or \"magnets,\" tackled city ordinances, food, legal advice, labor union outreach and other details.\nThere were no official leaders, no president, no board of directors. Proposals came from the magnets and were voted on at the twice-daily general assemblies.\nThat first protest drew more than 1,000 people. But since then, Occupy Austin's public face has looked a little ragged. During the day at City Hall - where protesters have set up a 24/7 occupation - signs generally outnumber people.\nBut a closer look at the movement shows more. About 100 people regularly show up for general assemblies. More than 1,000 people participated Saturday in a march to Chase Bank.\nOccupy Austin's website, which the U.S. Library of Congress has decided to archive with its Internet materials on public policy topics, has gotten more than 1.1 million hits.\nIts Facebook page has more than 14,000 followers. It is developing an online radio station.\nAnd unlike many other groups, including Occupy Wall Street itself, Occupy Austin has a concrete list of demands for the government, such as limits on corporate contributions to political campaigns and tax reform so \"corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes.\"\n\"This thing is coming together,\" said Occupy Austin member Peter Morales , a general contractor participating in the protest. \"It's evolving every day.\"\nEpisode 2\nNuts and bolts\nThe scene: The general assembly on a recent weeknight at Austin City Hall\nThe cast: Harried facilitator, angry poet, sacred prayer lady, more than 100 protesters\nThe plot: Calm meeting quickly spins out of control\nThe light was fading, but tempers were rising.\nA meeting that had begun with a rational discussion about future events morphed into an argument over police oppression.\nAn angry poet grabbed the microphone to vent. A woman stood up to sing a sacred prayer. A competing group crooned a different song. The meeting facilitator succumbed to the chaos.\n\"I think that this meeting cannot be facilitated,\" she said, her voice trailing off.\nYou didn't have to be there to see it. The whole thing was broadcast on Livestream.com.\nEvery day, twice a day, Occupy Austin protesters meet on the plaza to discuss their plans for the movement. Until recently, the assemblies had a loose structure that left the agenda to be determined by the group, and that wasn't working, Benini said.\nThat night, organizers regrouped, switching up the meeting format to committee updates, announcements and an open forum that takes place in smaller groups without a microphone. Since then, meetings have been more constructive, but they are hardly conflict-free.\n\"You suck!\" one man screamed at a speaker last week. \"Shut up! I am your personal heckler!\"\nSimilar divisions have erupted online. In one recent incident on the Occupyaustin.org forums, someone posted an angry exchange between two people. The site moderator deleted it, generating fierce criticism.\n\"That thread should not have been deleted!!\" one person wrote. \"I just posted on it and we were all voicing our opinions and in no way should it have been deleted. THAT IS GOING TO DIVIDE US!!!\"\nCensorship has been a recurring theme of complaints. Critics charge that Facebook posts questioning the movement regularly disappear.\nAnton Montoya, who works for a local e-commerce business and is a member of Occupy Austin's Web team, said organizers are not deleting anything off Facebook and missing posts have likely been removed by the spam filter.\nModerators are, however, deleting posts off Occupy austin.org that the Web team deems hate speech or personal attacks.\n\"We will not allow that on the pages we are responsible for,\" Benini said. \"That is called being responsible to our community.\"\nAustin isn't the only area to face such conflicts. Earlier this week, news stories detailed arguments within Occupy Wall Street in New York over issues such as diversity and strategy. And though things have improved, Occupy Houston's early demonstrations were frozen when participants argued so much that they couldn't decide where to march, said member Joshua Pineda, 25, a Houston resident who recently joined the Austin effort.\n\"The inexperience was massive amongst our ranks,\" he said.\nAll of this, experts say, is typical of social movements. Friction is natural when trying to organize large groups of people, all of whom have their own perspectives and agendas.\nThe consequences of that friction vary, said Amin Ghaziani , an assistant professor in the sociology department of the University of British Columbia.\nIt can hurt recruitment or spur the creation of splinter groups, he said. It also leaves the movement vulnerable to a \"divide and conquer\" strategy by critics and the media who might seek to dilute the group's message, he said.\nSeries finale\nor renewal?\nBut it's not all bad news.\n\"On the other hand, groups that are subjected to intense scrutiny and negative publicity often band together very tightly, clarify their message, and end up with a unit that is actually more cohesive because of the attention others pay to its internal disputes,\" Ghaziani said.\nThe diversity of opinions within the group has also brought a diversity of resources, like business owners offering free food, welders building makeshift showers outside base camp and lawyers providing free legal advice. Many of the occupiers have developed strong friendships cultivated by working together 12 to 14 hours a day.\n\"I see people growing and respecting each other more and more,\" said Ellis McClane , a 19-year-old online book seller. \"It's a beautiful thing.\"\nAnd so, for now, Occupy Austin is still writing new episodes for itself.\nWhether the movement can continue to move forward is an open question. But Occupiers aren't going anywhere, said Tom Friedley, a 53-year-old radio broadcaster volunteering for the effort.\n\"Right now, we're just going through growing pains,\" he said. \"If this was easy, people would have done it by now.\"\naball@statesman.com; 912-2506\nNew York\nThe global movement began here Sept. 17, when hundreds of people protested against Wall Street  profits in  Manhattan . About 150 people  stayed overnight in Zuccotti Park, a privately owned public space near Wall Street. Protesters have since sponsored  rallies and marches addressing financial inequity and other issues. More than 700 have been arrested as of Oct. 15.\nWashington\nOccupy D.C. began Oct. 1 in McPherson Square, about two blocks from the White House. Some participants  clashed with police Oct. 8, which prompted the closure of the National Air and Space Museum. Occupy organizers said they've scaled back daily protests and have begun to hold 'teach-ins' on government corruption and money in politics.\nSeattle\nOn the West Coast, Seattle protesters have occupied Westlake Park and City Hall Plaza since late September; hundreds were routed and eight were arrested in the city Monday  after defying the city's ban on tents in public parks. At least 3,000 people marched Saturday  to Pike Place Market, where 200 sat down  on First Avenue and blocked traffic for about 10 minutes.

Peacefully.\"\nIn fact, the Occupy movement is deeply rooted in anarchist traditions and values. Many of the national Occupy movement's organizational tools \u2014 the lengthy general assemblies, the finger-waggling exercises in consensus-building, the free food and clothing available throughout camp \u2014 come from anarchist models of direct action, horizontal organizing, and gift economies.\nIn Boston specifically, Occupy draws on the experiences of the local direct-action activist community: the anarchists and DIY enthusiasts who have long organized non-hierarchically in collective houses and radical book shops. The current occupation in Dewey Square is ultimately providing a national stage for a fringe population that has espoused these anti-corporate ideals for years. But suddenly \u2014 as the protesters chanted to the BPD on Sunday night \u2014 \"the whole world is watching.\"\nZaina (the activists interviewed asked that we not use their last names) is a 20-year-old BU student who volunteers in Occupy Boston's food tent. She's also a veteran of Food Not Bombs, an international grassroots network of independent groups that serve free vegetarian meals to all comers. Using mostly salvaged food, Food Not Bombs, like Occupy, is distinctly anti-capitalist. Before the Occupation, FNB's focus was on providing two meals a week \u2014 one in Central Square, one in Boston Common \u2014 mostly to homeless people and traveling kids. Now, Zaina and other FNB regulars work alongside other Occupy volunteers, serving food around the clock to the camp's residents and visitors; they've already fed hundreds.\nIn the next tent over from food, the \"Really Really Free Market\" offers a space where anyone can drop off unwanted items (mostly clothing) and/or pick up something they need \u2014 for free. It's based on the radical anarchist concept of a \"gift economy.\" In stark contrast to market economies, there's no expectation of direct compensation for giving. Local collective houses organized RRFMs in Allston's Ringer Park throughout this past summer.\nBut the influence of anarchist culture on the Occupation goes beyond the notion of a free exchange of goods and services. For good or ill, the interminable, self-involved \"general assemblies\" \u2014 something often picked out as a weakness of the Occupy movement \u2014 also have their roots in the anarchist underground. It's called \"horizontal organizing,\" decision-making without a command hierarchy or a leader.\n\"I don't think consensus organizing and horizontal organizing is exclusively anarchist,\" says Jacob, who lives in a cooperative house in lower Allston. \"But it is an idea that we use and love. And I think that it is really addictive. When you participate in a collaborative process, long and slow as it is, at the end . . . every time we pass a decision, the crowd at the GA just roars. Just because we made it, we got through, we heard everybody's voice. And it feels good. . . . It's crazy. And so beautiful.\"\nAs the Occupy movement spreads to dozens of cities, it is bringing with it a new organizational structure that is fundamentally different from the marches and the protests of the Civil Rights era and, later, progressive protests against the Vietnam war.\nFor anarchists, the Occupy movement is transforming their intrinsic daily practices into tactics utilized by the masses.\n\"When I go to meetings, we do the twinkles all the time,\" says Zaina, referring to the now-ubiquitous hand gesture that indicates an occupier's support for a given idea. \"And to see hundreds of people doing that now is so great. . . . This has been spread across so many people, you just look around, and you see 200 people doing the twinkles, and it's just so great.\"\nOccupy  Boston protesters march alongside Veterans for Peace, as well as other activist groups such as Jobs with Justice and the AFL-CIO, at Downtown Crossing on October 13, 2011.\nOn November 17, 2011, hundreds of Occupy Boston and MassUniting marchers (labor unions, community organizers; SEUI, Local Ironworkers, Jobs for Justice, and more) took to the city streets again in solidarity with another global day of action.", "metadata": {"city": "Boston", "article_number": "1186", "filename": "1186Boston-thephoenixnews-03.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-12", "state": null, "version": "31", "annotators": ["EDC"], "periodical": "thephoenixnews", "periodical_code": "03"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 10, "uuid": "4eb695fb-8b25-4bc2-b9fc-409983c74247", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 10, "uuid": "00abab69-64ac-43f2-ac8f-f43ad45d1709", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 39, "uuid": "2a1ec72d-4676-4548-9f9d-52a9ce20b464", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[4760, 4939, "Occupy  Boston protesters march alongside Veterans for Peace, as well as other activist groups such as Jobs with Justice and the AFL-CIO, at Downtown Crossing on October 13, 2011."]]}, {"id": 40, "uuid": "8e23ff52-6710-40e6-a122-39bd9f108d61", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 2, "offsets": [[4940, 5182, "On November 17, 2011, hundreds of Occupy Boston and MassUniting marchers (labor unions, community organizers; SEUI, Local Ironworkers, Jobs for Justice, and more) took to the city streets again in solidarity with another global day of action."]]}, {"id": 41, "uuid": "2a3a0f8e-b55e-4b42-9f70-423973566199", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[198, 337, "Just hours after his men finished wiping the Greenway's manicured gardens with the bellies, knees, and faces of Occupy Boston last Tuesday,"], [1858, 1940, "the protesters chanted to the BPD on Sunday night \u2014 \"the whole world is watching.\""]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 171, "article_number": 6673, "uri": "urn:article:6673:799bb816-a5a3-45c7-84be-4e89d79d0681", "sha256": "25696bc7f2c7f4a6ecf3927100ed03bb0d0351291e2548bd6312539fc2b8f5a6", "batch_name": "article", "text": "15 of 63 DOCUMENTS\nThe Associated Press State & Local Wire\nOctober 14, 2011 Friday 5:38 PM GMT\nPolice arrest 1 Occupy San Diego protester\nSECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL\nLENGTH: 130 words\nDATELINE: SAN DIEGO\n\n\nAnti-Wall Street demonstrators in San Diego have formed a human chain around a tent in a downtown plaza where they've camped out for a week and are refusing police orders to take it down.\nPolice on Friday began removing about a half-dozen tents after warning demonstrators that their personal belongings couldn't stay in the Occupy San Diego camp.\nAuthorities say demonstrators can continue protesting without the tents, tarps and tables.\nLt.

The budding anti-Wall Street movement began last month with a vague sense of grievance over the widening gap between the rich and poor in America.\nBut in three weeks, it has provided fuel for a broader national message of financial despair. Protesters have spoken out about the lack of jobs and opportunities. Organizers in Washington, D.C., plan a march at Freedom Plaza on Thursday to \u201cdenounce the systems and institutions that support endless war and unrestrained corporate greed.\u201d\nBrought together by social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook, participants hope the New York protests can plant the seeds of a permanent national movement.\nIn San Francisco, protesters initially spent about a week at the Bank of America building at 555 California St. The group then moved to Union Square until they were asked to leave after about a day. That is when they began building a semipermanent camp on Market Street, c omplete with tents and a makeshift cooking area under a blue tarp held up between trees and bushes.\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, about 40 people were setting up for a rainy night and some protesters said police had already asked them to move. Rob Benson, one of the protesters in his late 30s, said police asked them to get a permit from the Department of Public Works, then they were redirected to another city department, then back to the police.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t permit the right to assemble,\u201d Benson said, adding that t he group is attempting to maintain good relations with police. \u201cIt\u2019s a right.\u201d\nA poster being circulated by the group calls on protesters to show up at the Federal Reserve Building at noon today. The material is being distributed on the website\noccupysf.com, which also is encouraging people to bring supplies for long-term camping, plus gardening equipment, art supplies, baby wipes and kiddie pools. The site also asks protesters to bring solar-powered chargers and smartphones with tethering capabilities to give the group roaming Internet access.\nThe scene Tuesday included casual interaction, tambourine playing, marijuana smoking and other fanfare.

Instead, the Occupiers decided they would stay in the park but leave if police told them to.\nThey plan to march from Smith Park to City Hall for the council's 6 p.m. meeting on Nov. 15. There, they will ask for permission to stay in the park 24 hours a day. If not granted, they would stay overnight and risk arrest.\nThey may not have to, however. Councilman Tony Yarber said he believes a majority of the council sees the protests as a \"social justice\" cause and would be receptive to granting permission to remain in the park.\nChris Mims, spokesman for Mayor Harvey Johnson, said he has not discussed the matter with Johnson but expects the mayor would go along with whatever the council decides.\nYarber said a special exception to the hours rule would be best, thus protecting a rule set by the city's permit division as a way to protect the city from liabilities for injuries that may occur in the park at night.\n\"We need to set down and outline their specific expectations and set conditions,\" he said.\nYarber, an educator, motivational speaker and business coach, said he admires the Occupy stand and would likely be \"involved at some level\" if he were not a public official.\nThe protesters in Jackson and in parks across the nation have cited a host of reasons for their movement but call themselves the \"99%\" that have been shorted by the nation's financial system and economic policies.

City Hall that is Occupy Los Angeles, in various modes of commitment and involvement.\nEarly on I was outraged both by my growing inability to cope financially despite working full-time and galvanized by images coming from Occupy Wall Street. After decades of passivity, finally it seemed a serious organic social justice movement was evolving in the United States.\nTo me it seems many participants early on were middle class whites propelled by a level of economic injustice and hardship that was new to them. A Wall Street boom and crash a la 1929 and alarming numbers of home foreclosures, unemployment, growing poverty levels and waves of people about to run out of unemployment insurance have led some to compare the Occupy movement to the tent cities of the Great Depression.\nWhile the plight of the middle class may have garnered the now-omnipresent media attention, minorities and the poor who have historically borne the brunt of economic injustice have gotten on board the Occupy train in hopes of finally equalizing the badly unbalanced status quo. There is now a crowd of roughly 500 very diverse people from all walks of life living at the L.A. encampment. The lawn is full to capacity. You can't take a step without trouncing someone's personal affects or tent tarp.\nOccupy L.A. is now figuratively the last man standing, as far as Occupy encampments. While authorities around the country have swept Occupiers out systematically, the city of L.A. has taken a largely hands-off approach.\nThat is, until last Thursday.\nThat's when the LAPD, decked out in full SWAT regalia, descended en masse on Occupy L.A. marchers joined by union members as they made their way up Broadway north of Fourth Street at about noon, across from Grand Central Market downtown. Police quickly closed Broadway, fencing off the street and sidewalk, ensuring that pedestrians wouldn't be able to see as they made what one witness later called a violent arrest.\nI'd been around Occupy L.A. for weeks and it was a surreal moment. For weeks I'd been seeing video footage of protesters in other cities get tear gassed, shot with rubber bullets and generally beat down by the police. But in L.A. the stand-offish stance taken by the police seems to have lulled people into a false sense of security.\nSo it was a shock to see the LAPD march in parade-style, with squad cars stacked as far as the eye could see down Fourth Street, even though it really shouldn't have been based on what's been happening nationwide.\n\"What have they done wrong?\" one onlooker asked an older police officer who was manning the LAPD's fence as fellow cops laid waste to the march. \"Don't you think it's weird that those people are getting arrested?\"\nThe officer smiled and responded wryly, \"Ask me when I'm retired.\"\nLater that afternoon I found myself at the Bank of America plaza downtown, pressed from a crowd behind me pretty much right up into the personal space of an unhappy LAPD officer in full riot gear, who kept telling me to move back as the people behind me were pushing me forward. I was watching my friends get handcuffed and an officer with a rubber bullet gun pace on a planter ledge in front of me. The cops outnumbered us by some ridiculous proportion. Someone told me because of city budget cuts, they weren't being paid overtime. Another person warned us that they were loading up the tear gas. The dispersal order was given. One line of cops said we had 5 minutes to leave. On the other side of the plaza they said we had 15.\nSome protesters cut through the palpable tension in the air with humor. A group sang the \"Fresh Prince of Bel Air\" theme song. A petite young woman apparently liked the looks of one officer and asked loudly if he was married. Others were more pointed in their humor.\n\"Oh good, they're here to evict Bank of America because of all the money they stole from us and all the houses they illegally foreclosed,\" protester Richard Florence said sarcastically as LAPD officers swarmed in on all sides.\nBut the skyscraping BofA building was safe. It wasn't the bank that the cops were there for.\nMy Occupy L.A. friends were pitching tents to \"occupy\" the Bank of America plaza. It was a gesture to confront the mega-bank responsible for millions of home foreclosures throughout the country with raw humanity. The juxtaposition of the newly-formed Occupy L.A. tent city at the foot of the behemoth Bank of America tower was somehow heart wrenching. It was like seeing David challenging Goliath and thinking David couldn't possibly have a chance. Before long their little tents were picked up and thrown aside by armored police as demonstrators were carried off in handcuffs. Somehow it all seemed the perfect analogy for what Bank of America and other institutions have been doing to homeowners by the millions in this country since the beginning of the foreclosure crisis.\nAnd I didn't know there were so many cops in L.A. I guess if I ever want the LAPD's help I'll bring a tent to Bank of America, because that is clearly the way to get them out in force.\nIn all, 72 Occupy L.A. activists were arrested Thursday, including two young men who simply crossed a police line at an early-morning union march. It reminded me of a caption I'd seen on a photo of NYPD officers manhandling a woman at Occupy Wall Street.\n\"If only they enforced bank regulations like they do park rules, we wouldn't be in this mess.\"\nIndeed.\nWhile Occupy L.A. has seen less than its fair share of police enforcement, I have a suspicion it's coming soon. While the L.A. City Council rolled out the red carpet early on, even distributing ponchos at one point, they now seem to be itching to get the tents and all the messy chaos that comes along with an indefinite encampment off their stoop. They've even gone as far as apparently negotiating an \"exit strategy\" with a small group of occupiers they've maintained clandestine contact with.\nBut protests don't work like that. And in the tradition of the Occupy movement, we'll peacefully hold our ground at City Hall as long as physically possible, and come back stronger, bigger and better after the inevitable police raid goes down.\nAnd even if they raid us and kick us out, we're already building a response. In response to a wave of attacks on Occupy sites and a lack of response to the needs of working people nationwide, plans are underway by Occupy L.A.'s newly-formed General Strike Committee to coordinate with Los Angeles and Long Beach port workers, Occupy Oakland and Occupy Long Beach to shut down all West Coast ports on Dec. 12. This will be followed by a build-up to a widespread general strike on May 1.\nBut until Thursday, Occupy L.A. hadn't had a lot of police contact. It's probably because, as others have noted, Occupy L.A. hasn't had a lot of action. Many of the protesters within the encampment and those participating outside it have noticed too and are frustrated. While protesters in New York were shutting down the Brooklyn Bridge, those in Oakland were shutting down a port, and those at UC Davis were forcing campus police and a chancellor to walk off in shame, Occupy L.A.'s weekend events have largely consisted of music festivals, lectures and most recently, a health fair. Not that these are bad things. They're good. But people are waiting for strategic action. And it's coming.\nI'm not saying I want to get a police baton over the head or have my skull fractured by a flash bang grenade like Iraq war veteran and protester Scott Olsen did when police raided the Oakland encampment last month. But I didn't get involved to hang out at L.A. City Hall and listen to music. As the Beatles said, \"we all want to change the world.\" Well we do. And right now the world seems to need some changing.\nThis may be because the initial tone at Occupy L.A., or OLA, as it's now being called, was set by people who at the early planning stages wanted to cooperate with the city so much that they got permission from the Police Department to set up their encampment. These same people also have functioned as \"city liaisons,\" reporting to and meeting with city officials and police without letting the rest of us know what's going on in those meetings. I'm pretty certain this type of activity would be shunned by other Occupy movement sites.\nDespite the frustrations, I see potential and haven't been able to walk away, like some have unfortunately done. There are wonderful, intelligent people who want to create a better world, and who seem to be waiting for the chance. And what better place than Los Angeles, California, maybe one of the most diverse metropolitan areas in the world? Now that the NYPD has raided and swept the encampment at Zucotti Park in New York City and many other locations, my understanding is that Occupy L.A. is the biggest and most tenable Occupy site remaining. So maybe my frustration will pay off in that Occupy L.A. has been left standing long enough to act as a beacon to Occupiers all over the country who have been displaced and want to enjoy a warm winter a la Los Angeles. I have heard they're already on their way from New York and Boston, and I've seen lots of people at Occupy L.A. from Oakland, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, Long Beach and Pasadena joining in.\nAnd while people may have their differences, 500 or so from the homeless to the Ivy League-educated, are camping at City Hall. There is no predominant race or class representation that I can see. It's a pretty well-blended mix of people who all share a common concern: The economic system is broken and doesn't work for most people, they want a better one and the U.S. political system isn't offering any realistic solution s.\nOn Sunday, L.A.-based band Aztlan Underground played and indigenous dancers performed in traditional costume on the south lawn of City Hall. The band's lead singer said Occupy L.A. was an autonomous community, much like the ones that governed indigenous people that lived on that very spot before they were wiped out by colonization. With the ghostly Native American-themed music accompanying feathered headdresses swishing and the smell of incense heavy in the air, all in the shadow of LAPD Headquarters towering in the background, it could have been a disjointed dream. But there was little doubt in my mind that Occupy L.A. and its sister sites all over the country and world are indeed autonomous from the system that replaced the Gabrielino Indians that used to live where we're pitching our tents now.\nBethania Palma Markus is a former reporter for this news group.\n\n\nLOAD-DATE: November 23, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nGRAPHIC: Bethania Palma\nOccupy Wall Street demonstrators rallies in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday, Nov. 17, 2011.

That tent\ncity was known as  Camp Runamuck.\nThe violations in this case include trespassing, remaining in the park past 9\np.m. curfew and sleeping in the park overnight, Padwa said. No filing date has\nbeen set; however, Mayor Angel Taveras said Monday he expected it will be filed\nwithin a few days.\nThe city is still seeking a permanent injunction in the Camp Runamuck case, but\nPadwa said he believes that the preliminary injunction set a precedent for the\nOccupy Providence case. The Supreme Court affirmed that preliminary injunction\nin June.\nWe showed a trespass, and a continuing trespass,  Padwa said, and  this is the\nsame.\nA chambers conference that may lead to a Superior Court hearing on that\npermanent injunction request in the Camp Runamuck case is set for Thursday,\nPadwa said.\nOccupy Providence is one of scores of grass-roots offshoots worldwide of the\nOccupy Wall Street movement in New York City s financial district that centers\non corporate greed and economic inequality.\nProtesters began camping overnight in Burnside Park next to Kennedy Plaza on\nOct. 15. There are now more than 100 tents.\nOn Monday, facing imminent legal action, some 200 protesters marched into City\nHall to request that they be allowed to stay indefinitely based on free-speech\nrights. They presented a letter with that request to Mayor Taveras and Public\nSafety Commissioner Steven M. Par\u00e9.\nPeter G. De Simone, co-counsel for the unnamed defendants in the Camp Runamuck\ncase, said he believes that the Occupy Providence case may involve  more serious\nissues of a constitutional nature.\n(De Simone said he does not represent the Occupy Providence protesters at this\ntime. De Simone s co-counsel, Neville Bedford, said Monday he has attended\nmeetings with Par\u00e9 and some of the protesters, but does not represent them. The\ngroup has no lawyer to date.)\nAny civil action the city would bring against the Occupy Providence campers\nwould raise new issues that would not be raised in Camp Runamuck; principally\nthe rights of assembly and free speech,  De Simone predicted.  I have no idea\nhow those would fare at this point. I wouldn t speculate.\nMeanwhile, Par\u00e9 said Tuesday that he d watched news reports of police arresting\nOccupy Oakland protesters and dismantling their tent city in front of Oakland's\nCity Hall earlier that morning, and noted,  That s what we re trying to avoid.\nOakland police in riot gear fired tear gas and beanbag rounds at around 5 a.m.\nand arrested 75 or 80 people, according to published reports. Oakland Police\nChief Howard Jordan said officers fired tear gas and beanbags after some\ndemonstrators hurled rocks and bottles at the police.\nIt s unfortunate that they had a number of protesters that acted in that\nbehavior, in the response to the police,  Par\u00e9 said.  It just escalates, and it\nends up getting people hurt, both police and protesters   that s how people get\nhurt and that s what we re trying to avoid.\nPar\u00e9 added,  It s volatile.

(AP) - Occupy Wall Street protesters and state officials in Tennessee squared off for a third consecutive night Saturday, even though a local judge has consistently refused to jail the demonstrators.\nThe protesters have been galvanized by the friction between state officials and the local magistrate. Several new demonstrators showed up at the state-owned plaza near the Capitol for the first time earlier in the day.\nFifty to 75 people remained after the curfew that started at 10 p.m. CDT and runs until 6 a.m. Police did not immediately move in. In previous nights, the defiance has led to arrests.\nThe Nashville arrests came after a week of police crackdowns nationwide on Occupy Wall Street activists, who have been protesting economic inequality and what they call corporate greed.\nClashes have occurred in other cities, including Oakland, Calif., Denver and Atlanta.\n\"My heart has been here all along, but the arrests gave me the momentum to come,\" said Vicki Metzgar, 61, director of a Nashville Public Schools science and math initiative. \"This (plaza) belongs to us, not the politicians.\"\nIn Oakland, Calif., an Iraq War veteran was seriously injured during a protest clash with police Tuesday night. In Atlanta, helicopters hovered overhead Wednesday as officers in riot gear arrested more than 50 protesters at a downtown park. In San Diego, police arrested a similar number of people who occupied the Civic Center Plaza and Children's Park for three weeks. And in Denver on Saturday evening, authorities moved into an encampment of protesters and began arresting demonstrators just hours after a standoff near the steps of the Colorado Capitol turned into a skirmish that ended in police force, including pepper spray and reports of rubber bullets.\nNashville magistrate Tom Nelson has said there's no legal reason in his city to keep the demonstrators behind bars and he has released them after each arrest. He has refused each night to sign off on arrest warrants for more than two dozen people taken into custody.\nSome legal experts agreed with the judge.\nThe arrests appeared to be a violation of First Amendment rights that allow for people to peacefully assemble, said attorney David Raybin, a former prosecutor. He and others said the nature of the arrests, coupled with the judge's refusal to sign off on the warrants, could become ammunition for lawsuits.\n\"The government is exposing itself to serious liability here by doing this,\" Raybin said.\nNelson did not return an email seeking and a phone number for him could not be found.\nState troopers began enforcing the curfew at the Legislative Plaza on Thursday night.\nOthers questioned the timing of the curfew. The protesters had been demonstrating for about three weeks before it took effect, a point that Nelson said he factored into his decision.\n\"You can't pass a curfew mid-protest because you disagree with this group of protesters,\" said criminal defense attorney Patrick Frogge, who is representing some of those arrested.\nThe state Department of Safety has been carrying out the arrests. Commissioner Bill Gibbons, who until he joined the Haslam administration was the district attorney in Memphis, said he didn't have a role in developing the curfew but assured Haslam his department could enforce it.\nGibbons developed a reputation as an able and tough prosecutor in Memphis, where gang and drug violence have been problems for years. He ran against Haslam for governor in the GOP primary, touting his law-and-order credential and sharply attacking his multi-million-dollar opponent for refusing to divulge how much income he gets from the family-owned chain of Pilot truck stops.\nCecily Friday, one of the original Occupy Nashville protesters, said the administration's attempt to get rid of the demonstrators has \"completely backfired.\"\n\"Over 1,000 people have been added to our Facebook page since the arrests,\" she said.\nOn Saturday afternoon, about 150 people showed up for an Occupy Nashville meeting. Lisa Keylon, a city planner, was there for the first time. She said she was recently in Atlanta, discussing with friends how unorganized the protests seemed, wondering how long they could last.\nThen people were arrested in Atlanta, followed by those in Nashville.\n\"Now people are fired up because their First Amendment rights are being violated,\" she said.\nAmong those arrested Friday night was journalist Jonathan Meador, who told troopers he was a reporter covering the story for the Nashville Scene alternative newspaper. On Saturday, the owner of the newspaper sent a letter to Haslam's staff.\n\"I expect the governor to publicly apologize to him for this violation of his rights and to assure the people of Tennessee that this administration will not interfere with the right to a free press that has been a fundamental right in this country since our founding,\" SouthComm CEO Chris Ferrell wrote. \"I'm sure you understand that every media outlet in this country will vigorously defend our right to cover government action without fear of arrest or reprisal.\"\n___\nAssociated Press Writer Kristin M.

No arrests were made and police are compiling a report on damages and identifying those who were involved.\nSeveral members of Occupy Santa Cruz said the River Street group never sought consensus from Occupy Santa Cruz.\nMeanwhile, about 6:30 a.m. Sunday near Occupy Santa Cruz's encampment, about 60 county sheriff's deputies removed an \"Occudome\" tent and other belongings of Occupy Santa Cruz that had accumulated near the courthouse steps on Water Street, but made no arrests and wrote no citations. Sheriff's Lt. Craig Wilson said deputies had been meeting with some group members before clearing the area, and that while a small group initially was combative, most had been cooperative.\nWilson said deputies left behind medications, signs and other property and are streamlining the reclamation process for those items law enforcement did confiscate. He said the group was welcome to protest there, but could not camp or block access to county buildings or walkways.\nBack across the river, police had been negotiating with people who took over the building that formerly housed Coast Commercial Bank at Water and River streets and then ordered them out Saturday afternoon. Authorities found the building empty when they arrived at 9:30 p.m. Saturday, police spokesman Zach Friend said. Sunday, the building's parking lot was cordoned off with yellow crime tape and a security guard stood watch.\nThe occupiers, who said they wanted to turn the building into a community center, had said they would leave the building by 3 p.m. Sunday, but police demanded they leave immediately, Friend said.\nA group called 75 River Community Center released a statement Sunday saying the occupiers \"chose to exit the building since it became clear that police were targeting a small group of individuals not directly involved with the occupation.\"\nThe group said in its statement, \"The police and some media have focused on Wells Fargo as the 'victim' in this scenario. ... The real injustice is people being pillaged out of homes they spent years working legitimately to obtain by an objectively greedy and inherently predatory legal entity.\"\nThe property was bought in 2008 by Wells Fargo, which has a branch across the street. County records indicate that the building's owner is Associates 1 and Thomson Property Tax Services.\nA woman leaving the building Sunday, who said she was a representative of the property owner, would say only that there was \"a lot of debris\" inside.\nPolice said the damage tally for the building's occupation would include law enforcement costs. Friend said charges against those involved could include trespassing, vandalism and conspiracy.\nChief Kevin Vogel said there was enough damage to arrest those inside for felony vandalism. Police say they have been documenting who's been inside the building and have several names, including a well-known anarchist.\n\"We'll be looking to prosecute these people to the fullest extent possible,\" Vogel said Saturday night. \"I'm quite pleased it was resolved this way. I'm sorry it had to get to this.\"\nMeanwhile, city leaders expressed satisfaction with the resolution of the occupation.\n\"I'm very pleased that we were able to resolve this without putting our officers and community at risk,\" Mayor Ryan Coonerty said. \"I appreciate the strategic leadership by our Police Department.\"\nThe Police Department had been crafting the exit strategy since Wednesday night when they backed off of their first attempt. That night about 30 officers in riot gear surrounded the entrance of the building but were met with close to 200 protesters who were blocking the entrance, which had been barricaded from the inside with office furniture.\nPolice decided to regroup and develop a strategy.\n \nLOAD-DATE: December 5, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nGRAPHIC: A member of Occupy Santa Cruz confronts a sheriff's deputy after the encampment on the courthouse steps was razed early Sunday morning.\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\nCopyright 2011 The Monterey County Herald\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Santa Cruz", "article_number": "7216", "filename": "7216Santa Cruz-montereycountyheraldcalifornia-06.txt", "date_published": "2011-12-05", "state": null, "version": "30", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "montereycountyheraldcalifornia", "periodical_code": "06"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 184, "uuid": "5657426b-01c7-4620-8518-6f69d1124773", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 184, "uuid": "5b617634-d7a0-475f-9aac-ef50ff2189e6", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 912, "uuid": "85e4758a-080d-485e-a09f-227e99b158d6", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[902, 1034, "Meanwhile, about 6:30 a.m. Sunday near Occupy Santa Cruz's encampment, about 60 county sheriff's deputies removed an \"Occudome\" tent"], [1035, 1123, "and other belongings of Occupy Santa Cruz that had accumulated near the courthouse steps"], [1124, 1184, "on Water Street, but made no arrests and wrote no citations."]]}, {"id": 913, "uuid": "8703db95-0754-4883-bd58-b6313e7b616e", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 3, "offsets": [[4092, 4373, "Wednesday night when they backed off of their first attempt.

As Occupy Chapel Hill moved from the Peace and Justice Plaza down to Greenbridge Development and back on Thursday night, they were accompanied by the presence of blue lights.\nThe crowd marched approximately 120 people strong, echoing chants including \"Streets of Chapel Hill beware, Zuccotti Park is everywhere,\" and \"Up with the streets, down with the walls.\" Expletives were sprinkled in a few, followed by chants of \"Freedom of speech.\"\nOccupy Chapel Hill/Carrboro organized the Solidarity March. Liz Reeves, a Chapel Hill resident who has been involved with the group since its creation, said though the turnout was larger than previous events, she wasn't satisfied.\n\"We can never have enough people,\" she said.\nBut, more people have been attending the group's daily general assembly meetings following a week of Occupy conflict both on the local and national level. Thursday's march began after that evening's meeting.\nEarly Tuesday, police in New York City emptied Zuccotti Park of its Occupy Wall Street protestors, sparking questions of censorship and police brutality.\nSeven protestors, some of whom had been involved with the Occupy movement, were arrested Sunday on misdemeanor counts of breaking and entering the former Yates Company Motors building on West Franklin Street. Occupy Chapel Hill/Carrboro reaches consensus in its assembly before making any collective actions, and these individuals had not been given consensus. But as guns were wielded, the same questions were raised in Chapel Hill that are being asked of police presence in New York.\n\"What happened in Zuccotti Park this week made me furious, and I figured this was the night to come out and do something,\" said Drew Lindberg. The march was the first event he's participated in with the Occupy movement.\nThe group marched down Franklin Street, and looped around on Rosemary, walking in front of and around cars.\nJeremy Westland, a former Chapel Hill resident, had been protesting with Occupy Santa Fe for a month before coming to North Carolina to get involved with Occupy UNC-Greensboro, where he used to be a student. But after seeing the weekend's events, he was inspired to support Chapel Hill's group.\n\"I think the police cracking down on occupations across the country is building them up more and driving the movement,\" he said. \"People are beginning to see that this is a police state.\"\nThe front of the march included some of those arrested Sunday.\nJeff Clark, Chapel Hill Police Captain, said the police's presence was due to the safety concerns of a large march occurring after dark and disturbing traffic. In addition to the normal downtown officers, the police employed three additional cars for traffic control, Clark said.\n\"The event went well; the crowd generally stayed on the sidewalks,\" Clark said. \"As long as we get through without any injuries, it's a success. Tonight was very successful.\"\nReeves said she believes the police presence was largely due to the fact that the break-in occurred after the group's last march, which she witnessed.\n\"After being held at gunpoint, I don't think the police are worried about my safety,\" she said.\nA march that is not directly related to Occupy Chapel Hill/Carrboro will be held 6 p.m. Monday starting from the Chapel Hill Police Department and going to the Town Council meeting, which will protest police brutality in response to the movements.\n \nLOAD-DATE: November 28, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\nCopyright 2011 The Durham Herald Co.\nAll Rights Reserved", "metadata": {"city": "Chapel Hill-Carrboro", "article_number": "1312", "filename": "1312Chapel Hill-Carrboro-chapelhillheralddurhamnc-05.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-20", "state": null, "version": "27", "annotators": ["SLG", "EDC"], "periodical": "chapelhillheralddurhamnc", "periodical_code": "05"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 13, "uuid": "7571b5f8-11fa-4e6b-9197-bdad6d998968", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 13, "uuid": "a1c3cd99-5735-48d3-a836-1daf5944de6f", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 56, "uuid": "ba33b5c1-8ef8-45ae-aea5-15f5ce66d25d", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[178, 352, "As Occupy Chapel Hill moved from the Peace and Justice Plaza down to Greenbridge Development and back on Thursday night, they were accompanied by the presence of blue lights."], [353, 403, "The crowd marched approximately 120 people strong,"], [618, 677, "Occupy Chapel Hill/Carrboro organized the Solidarity March."], [1049, 1101, "Thursday's march began after that evening's meeting."], [1962, 2069, "The group marched down Franklin Street, and looped around on Rosemary, walking in front of and around cars."], [2776, 2883, "In addition to the normal downtown officers, the police employed three additional cars for traffic control,"], [2896, 2963, "\"The event went well; the crowd generally stayed on the sidewalks,\""]]}]}]}]}, {"id": 147, "article_number": 5498, "uri": "urn:article:5498:318e6ffa-0ab2-49e6-8dc6-3c629017cfc2", "sha256": "f1adc8b2fdfbe8e59eddb5798f17001dc542b69b9c6a5068b18f7282f294b8c7", "batch_name": "article", "text": "Without permit, Occupy Philly returns to Dilworth\nTuesday, November 22, 2011\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA - November 17, 2011 (WPVI) -- Commissioner Charles Ramsey told Action News there were no plans to move any Occupy Philly demonstrator Thursday night.\nRamsey gave the late night update shortly after John F. Kennedy Boulevard had been shut down due to protestors moving from Dilworth Plaza to Thomas Paine Plaza and back again.\nIt was a chaotic scene beginning around 10:15 p.m. as occupiers decided to move across the street.\n\"It was a bit chaotic with people going back and forth, but there were no injuries, it was peaceful,\" Ramsey said.\nOnce over at Paine Plaza, the occupiers were met by a group of officers that said they needed to head back due to a lack of a permit.\n\"Apparently during a general assembly meeting, it was decided for an impromptu move over to Paine Plaza at MSB; there's no permit for this site. We're trying to work with the protestors to find an alternative once they do vacate Dilworth Plaza so the construction can resume. They did voluntarily vacate and go back over to Dilworth Plaza,\" Ramsey explained.\nRamsey said the move was unexpected because the arrangements are still being discussed between City Hall and the protestors.\nMayor Michael Nutter told Action News' Jim Gardner Wednesday night, there has been no permit application signed by the City of Philadelphia.\nThe Mayor and Occupy Philly have not agreed on any of the conditions that would be in effect once a move takes place from Dilworth Plaza to Thomas Paine.\nThe Mayor told Jim he is concerned over health conditions and does not want to see the conditions that exist now in Dilworth Plaza repeated once a move is taken across the street.\nWith no permit, the occupiers returned to the Dilworth Plaza where they have been situated for 43 days.\n\"Until the City decides, working with the protest groups, for now they will stay at Dilworth Plaza, but of course, obviously, they're going to have to leave that spot because construction is going to start soon,\" Ramsey said.\nOn Wednesday, the city ordered the protesters to leave the site immediately so that the $50 million renovation work could begin at Dilworth Plaza.\n\"This project's commencement is imminent,\" the statement said. \"Accordingly, you should take this opportunity to vacate Dilworth Plaza and remove all of your personal belongings immediately.\"\nThe project, mostly paid for by federal and state grants, would replace concrete surfaces with public green space, improve access to the disabled, and revamp the transit system concourses. It would also put in a cafe that would remain lighted at night, a partially tree-covered lawn that could be used for concerts and a programmable fountain that could be turned off to allow other uses, such as ice skating, concerts or outdoor markets.\nMayor Michael Nutter says delay of the renovation project would stand in the way of more than 1,000 jobs, and tents need to move for the maintenance work.\n\"It's my understanding there have been discussions including today about where the relocation will take place,\" Ramsey said.\nRamsey dispelled the rumor that the relocation would take place this night.\n\"My understanding, there was some rumor going around we were going to do that and that's simply not true. You see all the policeman here today, simply because of the actions that took place earlier,\" Ramsey said.\nRamsey was referring to Occupy Philadelphia demonstrators marching through downtown and stopping at the Market Street bridge, blocking traffic in the process, as part of a nationwide \"day of action.\" 24 people were arrested.\n\"All in all we had some arrests earlier today, but these are people that want to be arrested. It was peaceful, it was no problem at all,\" Ramsey said.\nJody Dodd, a member of Occupy Philadelphia's legal collective, said she's gotten a sense that support is growing for the idea to move, especially after members heard the concerns of union leaders.\n\"Labor has been with us from the beginning,\" Dodd said. \"The labor movement's concerns are our concerns.\"\nThe demonstration overall is aimed at condemning the influence of big corporations on government, protesting economic disparity and showing solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York.\nEarlier in the day, several members interrupted a session of Philadelphia City Council, expressing concern over issues including the city's new youth curfew law.\n\"So far, we've been able to have some lines of communication, I just hope that continues,\" Ramsey said.", "metadata": {"city": "Philadelphia", "article_number": "5498", "filename": "5498Philadelphia-abcgo.local.com-08.txt", "date_published": "2011-11-22", "state": null, "version": "30", "annotators": ["CRV"], "periodical": "abcgo.local.com", "periodical_code": "08"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 144, "uuid": "b2af84fe-15aa-49a6-aebf-1a456be2171d", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 144, "uuid": "f587dedc-bddb-4be8-a05b-9c5f29b57678", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 672, "uuid": "fd602817-0b5c-4214-a1d9-0cacbc16d98d", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Police", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[3303, 3386, "all the policeman here today, simply because of the actions that took place earlier"]]}, {"id": 676, "uuid": "da8dea12-681b-4726-9e99-e4216cb7eb6a", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[290, 417, "John F.

SIMPKINS / THE TENNESSEAN\n\n\nHundreds of marchers from across Tennessee converged Saturday in Nashville to protest what they see as a country where corporations have more of a voice in government than citizens do.\n\u201cOccupy Wall Street, Occupy Nashville, occupy everything and never give it back,\u201d protesters chanted during a city-sanctioned march that threaded a six-block loop between the Metro Courthouse and Legislative Plaza.\nThe march was one of many held in cities around the country and globe to support the ongoing Occupy Wall Street protests in New York. A small group of protesters in Nashville has been occupying Legislative Plaza for the past week and plans to continue doing so indefinitely.\nBefore the march came a rally, in which participants took turns sharing their stories. Three generations of the Warren family drove down from Lobelville, Tenn., to say their piece.\nMichael Warren took his place in the center of the gathering and spoke his piece \u2014 the protesters chanting back every sentence so his words carried to the far edges o f the crowd of 200-plus.\n\u201c Things are not right, and they don\u2019t appear to be getting better,\u201d said Warren, who wrote to his senators and Rep. Marsha Blackburn but said he received only form letters in response to his story. The family lives in Perry County, where the unemployment rate hit 25 percent in 2009. Warren\u2019s wife and daughter operated a thriving small business that went under when the economy tanked.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything right and we\u2019re getting nowhere,\u201d said his daughter, Emily Weight, whose company, Nana\u2019s Jetpack, sold baby carriers that she and her mother designed and sewed, shipping them to stores around the country. \u201cI\u2019m here because I want some change.\u201d\n'Keep it peaceful'\nSaturday\u2019s rally was an orderly affair. Marchers threaded up Deaderick Street to Sixth Avenue, looped around to Union and marched back to the courthouse. There was no visible police presence, and the marchers took pains to stay on the sidewalk and stick to the route outlined on the permit issued by the city.\n\u201cI feel people here are really sincere about wanting a change for peace and justice,\u201d said Salina Khan of Murfreesboro, who came to the rally with her husband and daughters Fatima, 9, Aleeza, 5, and Sakina Razzaq, 4. The girls colored her protest sign: \u201cUnited Against Injustice.\u201d\nWhen it was Khan\u2019s turn to speak, she urged the crowd: \u201cDon\u2019t let them divide us by religion, race or social class. We will win if we stay as one.\u201d\nOver the past week, Occupy Nashville has made itself at home on Legislative Plaza. Newer and lower-key than its Wall Street counterparts, the group provides its members with food, shelter, and medical and legal assistance as they camp out on the hard granite of one of Nashville\u2019s most public places.\nThe Southern Festival of Books obligingly carved out a space for the occupation this weekend. Sleeping bags and tables of food are tucked away behind the festival\u2019s tents and performance spaces.\n\u201cWe want to keep it civil, keep it peaceful, keep it mature,\u201d said protester Phillip Schlicher, standing next to a table of donated food and a sign outlining the rules for participating in the protest: Throw away your trash and recycle your recyclables; respect others who use the plaza; speak for yourself, not the group.\nOccupy Nashville is a leaderless organization, with decisions made by group consensus \u2014 and anyone who wants to take part can come down and participate in the daily assemblies, held at 1 p.m. on weekends in the plaza and 7 on weeknights.\nJacob Kaset, a Nashville landscaper, comes down to the protest every night after work.

The demonstrators have been in the park illegally for the past 6 days, in violation of a city ordinance. \n\"As mayor, I am proud of the city of Atlanta's heritage as the birthplace of the civil rights movement,\" Reed said in a statement released by his office. \"At the same time, I am committed to protecting the public and ensuring that the laws of the city are respected. I will not allow public safety to be jeopardized in any way by the protesters. So far, all of their actions have been peaceful and nonviolent.\"\nThe situation has created a quandary for city officials and police who have asked them to leave. The city has not enforced the ordinance, allowing the protesters to remain.\nOccupy Atlanta spokesman Tim Franzen said he was happy to hear of the executive order, but that they would not be deterred and plan to hold their ground.\n\"We're in a position right now where we feel like either way, we're doing what we need to do,\" Franzen told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. \"When we get evicted, there will be people who will put their bodies on the line nonviolently and go to jail.\"\nFranzen said King's legacy has also factored into his strategy, and that the Atlanta protest is different from those in other parts of the country.\n\"We're in Martin Luther King's backyard,\" he said. \"Our leaders learned decades ago that we can't afford to brutalize protesters here.\"\nThe Occupy Atlanta protesters left the park briefly Tuesday to march to the Atlanta headquarters of Bank of America.

About 50 protesters in Boston were arrested Monday night when they ignored warnings to move from a downtown greenway near where they have been camped out for more than a week, according to police. Several hundred protesters were arrested in New York more than a week ago after police said they ignored warnings to stay in place.\nThe park closes to the public at 11 p.m. under city law.

Speakers, music, and rallying against corporate America were all included in the day's activities.\nA wide variety of signs supporting or protesting various causes could be seen, but Mardell Glinski-Schultz of Greenhills told Fox 19, \"If you walk around and look at the signs, almost everybody brought out their own agenda, but I think that there is a common denominator and I think that common denominator is greed. It's the power of the corporations. The government is no longer for the people, and every one of these issues in its own separate way relates to that.\"\nAccording to occupycincinnati.org, the group believes that 1% of the country's population has amassed 99% of the wealth. Justin Jeffre attended the protest also, \"We believe we have a duty to make this a better, more fair, equitable society. We have too much poverty. We have too much adult poverty and child poverty in this country and we're here to change that. We're here to demand change.\"\nSimilar protests have spread from New York City to cities across the country, and beyond.  But critics of the group's message are speaking up, too.  In Washington D.C., House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said of the growing protests, \"I for one am increasingly concerned about the growing mobs occupying Wall Street and the other cities across the country. And believe it or not, some in this town have actually condoned the pitting of Americans against Americans.\"\nIn Cincinnati, Hamilton County Republican Party Chair Alex Triantafilou tweeted Saturday, \"I'm going to occupy my office so I can make a living.\"  He told Fox 19 that he completely understands that people are very frustrated with current economic conditions but he disagrees that corporate America should be their target, \"We can bash corporations but some great corporations exist in our community and create lots of jobs so look, I understand the frustration about this but at the end of the day, corporations create jobs and that's important.\"\nIt's estimated that about 500 people took part in the protest.  Cincinnati Police say it remained a peaceful one.\nAccording to the Occupy Cincinnati Twitter and Facebook pages, protesters will gather again Sunday at Garfield Park at 6:00 am, with a General Assembly meeting at 2:00 pm.", "metadata": {"city": "Cincinnati", "article_number": "1668", "filename": "1668Cincinnati-FOX19-03.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-09", "state": null, "version": "27", "annotators": ["EDC"], "periodical": "FOX19", "periodical_code": "03"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 24, "uuid": "f23d7856-70b4-48a8-9860-807a7600eaf4", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 24, "uuid": "14b73c43-fb01-4303-a880-e08526301b22", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 112, "uuid": "4cb140f6-8948-4582-a9f8-48eb48bc147f", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[179, 251, "Hundreds gathered at Lytle Park Saturday morning to \"Occupy Cincinnati.\""], [2343, 2456, "It's estimated that about 500 people took part in the protest.

The demand involved Ruth Murman, a woman going through foreclosure. U.S. Bank and GMAC agreed to give Murman an extra two weeks to vacate her house.\nRuth Murman has lived in her home in Plymouth for five years, along with her 79-year-old father, a disabled Korean War veteran. According to Murman's attorney, Zach Crain of Moore Costello & Hart, the redemption period for Murman's home ended September 18.\nThe confusion started when Murman received her first notice after her redemption period ended. \"I received a notice on the door that they needed to know who was living there and what the plans were,\" recalled Murman. \"I called and talked to a gal named Jen Crockett. She asked our situation and I said we really need about 45 days to be out.\"\nAlthough Jennifer Crocket was the contact name on the notice, Crockett didn't work directly for U.S. Bank. She works for Keller Williams Realty, which had been handling Murman's foreclosure as a third party for GMAC, and it was through Crockett that Murman received information about her foreclosure situation.\nCrockett sympathized with the situation, according to Murman, and told her she'd contact U.S. Bank and let her know if there was anything else Murman needed to know or do \u2014 but that was the only time she heard from Crockett.\n\"The next thing I know, I have an eviction summons from U.S. Bank and a hearing,\" said Murman. She said she received the eviction summons on October 4, a month before she had been expecting it.\nUnder Murman's original understanding of the situation, she had until November 15 to leave her house, which was 45 days from the time she last spoke with Crockett. U.S. Bank and GMAC, however, continued on their original schedule, asking Murman to leave by sometime around October 12.\nMurman and her lawyer fought it and she was given until October 31 to leave, \"which was still ridiculous,\" said Murman. \"I mean there was still no way to do it.\"\nMurman runs a small business in Minnetonka called Auntie Ruth's Animal Care and Wellness Center, where, because of the economic crisis and its impact on her business, she hasn't taken a paycheck in three years. Between running the business, her financial situation and taking care of her father, Murman found it unreasonable for the bank to ask her to move out earlier than November 15.\nMurman's house was sold at a foreclosure sale back in March. Minnesota foreclosure law typically allows six months to attempt to buy the house back \u2014 this is known as the redemption period. When the redemption period ends, the owner has to leave or be evicted. For a helpful infographic describing the entire, complicated foreclosure process, see the website of the Minnesota Home Ownership Center.\nAfter the redemption period ended, the bank had no legal obligations to grant Murman's requests for extensions of time to stay in the house. However, Occupy MN organizers believed that ethically the bank should be held responsible when their customers are facing financial trouble such as Murman's.\n\"I feel that U.S. Bank is not representing the interests of its customers, of Americans, or anyone else,\" declared a speaker at the rally on Wednesday afternoon before the march, \"I'm here to say we can do a moratorium on foreclosures and stop lining the pockets of (US Bank) CEOs and the top people at U.S. Bank.\"\nThe additional two weeks U.S. Bank agreed to give Murman Wednesday morning was seen as a huge victory by Occupy protesters and Murman alike, as this brought her move-out date to November 15, allowing her the time she needed to make proper arrangements. According to Murman, it was no longer than two hours after Occupy MN put up a video about Murman's situation and called U.S. Bank CEO, Richard Davis, that Murman received calls from the bank, informing her about their change of heart.\nMurman is now currently negotiating terms with the bank over receiving help with moving costs, in exchange for leaving the property in a clean condition.\nCoverage of issues and events that affect Central Corridor neighborhoods and communities is funded in part by a grant from Central Corridor Collaborative.\nLink: http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/news/2011/10/28/occupy-mn-continues-us-bank-protest-delays-account-closures", "metadata": {"city": "Minneapolis", "article_number": "4219", "filename": "4219Minneapolis-DailyPlanet-07.txt", "date_published": "2011-10-28", "state": null, "version": "29", "annotators": ["SLG"], "periodical": "DailyPlanet", "periodical_code": "07"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 108, "uuid": "041c6eb4-0092-4461-9415-15e0849156a1", "generator": {"id": 1, "uuid": "897710ef-ff3e-4101-a2fa-cbe512c4fbf2", "name": "article", "task_config": {}}, "highlight_taskruns": [{"id": 108, "uuid": "b9569e37-d013-4566-99ee-93a2d2381222", "contributor": {"id": 1, "uuid": "3b085d42-039a-46e1-b9e5-9b4133f2a681", "unique_label": "Gold Standard DF"}, "include_in_IAA": true, "highlights": [{"id": 492, "uuid": "a06ff18d-923a-430a-9fa7-1b5ee341aa60", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 1, "offsets": [[377, 408, "they still marched on the bank."]]}, {"id": 493, "uuid": "74cb8926-26cb-42a5-830c-860a3eefe113", "namespace": "", "topic_name": "Protester", "case_number": 2, "offsets": [[3548, 3580, "the rally on Wednesday afternoon"], [3581, 3598, "before the march,"]]}]}]}]}]
