Dozens of Occupy Albany protesters, younger and old, entered New York's Capitol on Thursday demanding a millionaire's tax in the state.
Security guards requested the team to end chanting whilst they asked questions and then let them into the building's public space.
The demonstrators have been calling for greater taxes on the wealthy, some thing hostile by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Senate Republican majority. Thursday's rally is part of the nationwide motion blaming Wall Street and the authorities for monetary woes and insurance policies favoring the rich, or about 1 percentage of Americans.
Some Albany protesters have been camped in a nearby park because Friday, the place the initial Occupy Albany demonstration was once held.
Protester Michael Fisk stated greater than 50 have been headed to Cuomo's workplace in the Capitol. The Albany Law School student said the march is a symbolic effort.
The governor, who was in New York City, had no instantaneous comment.
"We're not making an attempt to do anything illegal here," said Trudy Quaif, 58, a protester from suburban Albany. "Gov. Cuomo is now not paying attention."
Quaif, who is retired, said the kingdom wishes to tax earners of more than $1 million a 12 months at a higher fee to pay for infrastructure improvements and better schools in order to entice greater jobs and business.
Signs in the Capitol included "Cuomo serves the one percent," and "Tax the Rich."
Once gathered inside, protesters commenced chanting: "We are the 99 percent."
