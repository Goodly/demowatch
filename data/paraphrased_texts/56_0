Police give Occupy Duluth encampment deadline
Duluth police are giving members of the Occupy motion a cut-off date to give up camping on a downtown plaza.
A letter on Duluth Police Chief Gordon Ramsay's letterhead gives protesters until 11:59 p.m. Sunday to limit their encampment to a single shelter.
The letter warns that if demonstrators refuse to comply, the metropolis will ask that all tents, signs and property be removed from the area. The letter says failure to comply with ordinances "will result in arrest."
Occupy Duluth participants inform the Duluth News Tribune (http://bit.ly/vpn8Yx) that two uniformed officers delivered the letter Wednesday.
Occupy members declined to remark on the letter Thursday.
