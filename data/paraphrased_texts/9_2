LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Los Angeles police used nearly a dozen undercover detectives to infiltrate the Occupy L.A. encampment in the weeks before their raid.
According to City News Service, the officers blended in to analyze about protestors' intentions and to see whether they planned to withstand or use weapons against police.
Nearly 300 human beings have been arrested at some point of Wednesday's predawn raid at City Hall Park.
Police are downplaying the magnitude of the undercover work, pronouncing Occupy meetings have been public and facts used to be convenient to get.
Meanwhile, Occupy L.A. protesters once again took to the streets on Saturday, with one man or woman reportedly being arrested through police.
The character was once reportedly arrested at the Bank of America branch at sixth and Hill streets in downtown Los Angeles.
Demonstrators had gathered there, with some allegedly banging on the locked doors.
As many as 200 human beings walked from Pershing Square to City Hall. For the most part, the demonstration was peaceful.
