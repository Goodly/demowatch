More than a month after taking up a perch in a sycamore at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza,
tree sitters came down Tuesday, Oakland police said.
At 8 a.m., public works crews began dismantling a structure erected in the
tree in early November by means of Zachary RunningWolf, alongside with three different wooden
platforms.
RunningWolf and a 2nd tree sitter took up residence in the tree as phase of
the Occupy Oakland protest and remained there after the Occupy tent town was
raided and dismantled by way of police Nov. 14.
RunningWolf used to be not present Tuesday morning when police arrived. Two different tree
sitters, who go by means of Sitting Frog and Jenna, voluntarily came down after police
told them crews were going to dismantle the structure.
Police stated the shape used to be deemed to be unlawful lodging and that human waste
had been found under the tree.
RunningWolf prepared a 21-month tree-sit in an oak grove near UC Berkeley's
football stadium that ended in 2008.
