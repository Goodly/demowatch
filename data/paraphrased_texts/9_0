Occupy Los Angeles protesters returned to the streets Saturday in a massive march that included many of the equal demonstrators who were arrested throughout a police sweep of their camp outside City Hall remaining week.
At least one person was once arrested for the duration of Saturdays heavily policed march in downtown L.A., curiously for failing to comply with police orders to continue to be on the sidewalk. Other protesters identified him as Anthony Lascano.
Lascano was one of nearly 300 demonstrators who had been arrested in early Wednesdays eviction, an intricate police motion that concerned some 1,400 officers.
To protest Lascano's 2nd arrest, which demonstrators said used to be unnecessary, the crowd marched previous the headquarters of the Los Angeles Police Department and to the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, where many Occupy arrestees had been detained. A line of police officers in rebellion gear blocked the doors.
Police Department spokesman Cleon Joseph verified that there had been an arrest at the protest but stated he did now not have more details.
Demonstrators complained that Lascano was once "tackled" by means of police. A video posted by using one marcher shows only part of the arrest.
About 100 Los Angeles police officers and non-public protection guards trailed the protesters as they marched Saturday, according to information reports. Police have maintained a giant presence at Occupy protests downtown in the days due to the fact that the eviction, in particular at some point of demonstrators nightly normal meeting conferences on the west steps of City Hall.
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who ordered the encampment closed because of fitness and protection concerns and due to the fact of damage to the lawn, recommended metropolis crews to hold the west steps open whilst the lawn is rehabilitated so that the protesters and everybody else have a area to gather.
