A man accused of putting fires at an Occupy Denver protest has been charged with arson.
Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey stated that 22-two-year-old Michael Clapper, of Westminster, was charged with 4 counts of fourth-degree arson on Thursday.
Clapper, of Westminster, allegedly set furnace to a shape and different particles in Civic Center Park on Monday. That's when police moved in to clear out the close by sidewalk that had served as the hub for the Occupy movement. Some makeshift buildings had been erected there and some went up in flames as police closed in.
A photo in The Denver Post suggests Clapper and another unidentified protester preserving a pizza field it's on furnace in a trash can.
Clapper was being held in jail. It's not known if he has a lawyer.
Eight different people have been arrested during the clearing out of Occupy Denver. District attorney's spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough stated most are accused of less serious offenses, such as failure to hear to police, and will in all likelihood be ticketed.
