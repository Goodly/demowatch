DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.


Hundreds of anti-Wall Street protesters defiantly remained at their campsite
outside Oakland's City Hall early Saturday, in spite of a metropolis order to vacate.
As the 10 p.m. time of the city's ultimatum exceeded Friday night, Occupy Oakland
demonstrators showed no signs and symptoms of departing as music blasted from the plaza. More
protesters arrived with tents as nighttime approached.
Earlier, metropolis spokeswoman Karen Boyd said that Oakland gave reliable note that
the protesters do now not have permission to stay overnight and that their
encampment is breaking the law. She would now not remark on what steps the city
would take toward imposing of the law. There was once no indication of significant
police presence early Saturday.
Boyd says that protesters can legally show at the plaza from 6 a.m. to 10
p.m.
