Occupy Seattle allowed to set up camp at Seattle Central CC
Judge backs SCCC's go to evict Occupy Seattle camp
SEATTLE -- Seattle Central Community College at the start stated Occupy Seattle wasn't welcome to occupy the campus. It has because had a alternate of coronary heart after realizing state legal guidelines don't permit the university to stop the movement's presence.
The group deliberate to march from Westlake to SCCC, the place they set up camp. This would not mean protesters won't still be at Westlake.
"This (Westlake) is the epicenter, this is as close to our Wall Street as we've got got," stated Bob Barnes.
Essentially, protesters will treat Westlake like their living room and the university as their bedroom, a region to rest.
Teachers joined the motion on Saturday, protesting outdoor of Chase Bank.
Teacher David Ehrich stated with the Governor's point out of more cuts on the way, he has to talk his mind.
"We're slicing instructions and instructions and lessons and the notion that we're going to cut more speaks to the fact that except we trade the income flow someplace right here in Washington, where we're taxing, we're in no way going to seize up," he said.
Protestors have been readying for an eight o'clock match at the college.
