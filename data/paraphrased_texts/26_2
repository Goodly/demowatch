Occupy SD Sets Up Small Tents In Civic Center
Protestors To Defy Police Orders About Personal Belongings In Civic Center Plaza


Members of Occupy San Diego set up about 25 tents in Civic Center Plaza on Monday, but it was once a far cry from a return to the tent city days of previous weeks.
Numerous tents have been set up at some point of the plaza after the Occupy San Diego movement commenced Oct. 7, however police twice swept in and had them taken down.
In a assertion to the media in the past today, Occupy San Diego spokesman Mike Garcia stated the tents would return, but did now not indicate they would be miniature versions. The tents, about two toes in diameter and made from fabric and wire, elicited laughter from supporters.
The protesters asked San Diego police Assistant Chief Boyd Long if they would be noted if they left the tents up in the plaza during their committee meetings, and he stated no citations would be given out. His response resulted in cheers from the protesters, countless of whom shook his hand.
Occupy San Diego participants marched into the plaza carrying the mini-tents and chanted their manifesto, which blanketed the phrase, "These tents are symbols of our reoccupation."
Garcia stated they took the motion in response to the arrest of a disabled member of the crew on Thanksgiving morning, and in solidarity with Occupy actions in different cities and with protesters in Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt.
Long and other police officials have stated seeing that the motion started out that the protesters ought to display in the plaza but now not set up tents.
