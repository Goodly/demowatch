Occupy Philadelphia Formally Applies To Relocate
PHILADELPHIA (CBS) two Mayor Michael Nutter says the Occupy Philadelphia motion has now formally applied to relocate its encampment throughout the road from City Hall to the plaza outside the Municipal Services Building.
Mayor Nutter says Occupys permit utility to move to the MSB will be given a full overview like any permit. But he makes clear that any approval will make certain there is no repeat of the security and sanitary problems that arose at the Dilworth Plaza encampment.
Those sorts of conditions can't be repeated at any achievable place that we would consider in phrases of a permit, Nutter explained.
There was once no on the spot word from Nutter on how long the allow assessment procedure will take.
Meanwhile, a team of about 40 Occupy Philadelphia protesters quickly disrupted the normal assembly of City Council Thursday morning, however left peacefully after about 10 minutes
