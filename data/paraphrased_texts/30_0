Singer receives to occupy D.C. cell
SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C02
LENGTH: 194 words

Raheem DeVaughn says he didn't set out to commit civil disobedience Sunday - he planned solely to hear Cornel West communicate to the Occupy D.C. protest. But one element led to another, and the Grammy-nominated crooner bought himself arrested, along with West and 17 different protesters, for refusing to go away the steps of the Supreme Court. They had been launched a day later - no fines, no charges.
So, penitentiary - how was it? Not bad, the Prince George's native told our colleague Aaron Leitko. "It used to be exceptionally by-the-book, popular procedure," he said over the phone. The police were "pretty pleasant," for the most part. "They had one awful apple out of the crew." Oooh, what did he do? Well, nothing, really. "It was once just his energy, man," DeVaughn said. "It may want to be that he used to be missing the football game. It was once a Sunday."
Any star-struck cellmates? "I may not say star-struck, however people sincerely knew who we were," he said. "We got an possibility to build with a lot of the brothers and for the younger cats to see us and embrace us."
And, yes, he'd completely do it again. "My group will likely hate to hear this, however this can also no longer be the final time I go to penitentiary for a factor that matters."
