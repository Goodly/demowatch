DATELINE: SCRANTON Pa.


Authorities have warned contributors of Occupy Scranton that they will have to take down their months-old encampment.
The Lackawanna County Sheriff's Office informed protesters they had to eliminate their tents in Courthouse Square with the aid of three p.m. Friday.
But the deadline handed with no action, and protesters have vowed to stay. Sheriff John Szymanski later advised The Times-Tribune that any action will be postponed until Monday.
Similar camps have sprung up across the united states to categorical cohesion with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York. The movement opposes monetary inequality and company influence on government.
On Friday, police dismantled the Occupy Allentown camp and evicted about 30 protesters. Mayor Ed Pawlowski said he had to stability the group's free speech rights with public safety.
