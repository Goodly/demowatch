DATELINE: FORT WAYNE Ind.


City officers have decided to permit Occupy Fort Wayne protesters to remain in a downtown park for at least a few greater days.
Officials with the police branch and Headwaters Park told the protesters Monday they could stay for at least a few extra days as lengthy as they stay peaceful and follow park rules. The Journal Gazette reports (http://bit.ly/obgupa) that metropolis officers at first told the demonstrators they desired them out of the park by 11 p.m. Sunday.
About 250 protesters confirmed up at a rally and march on Saturday. About a dozen or so protesters have been at the park on Monday.
Twenty-seven-year-old Kasey Griffith says she is protesting that companies exert too a lot affect over lawmakers.
