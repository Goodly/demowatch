Occupy Columbia protesters hit the road
COLUMBIA (WACH)-- Occupy Columbia protesters took their rally on the avenue Tuesday evening, marching from the State House to Columbia City Hall.
Nearly 100 protesters got here out to oppose the viable sale of Capital City Stadium on Assembly Street to a developer that works with outlets like Walmart. At this point, town leaders havent proven if a principal chain shop would locate in that space.
If thats the case, it will be very unfavourable to businesses in the City of Columbia, said protester Mel Jenkins.
He and fellow protesters say the Occupy movement is all about conflict huge business.
Midlands development leaders say the property is an eye-catching vicinity for developers. They add if a big-box shop like Walmart were to hit upon in the downtown area, it should appeal to even more business.
However, protesters say the contrary will happen.
It will kill the small corporations that have been in the community for a long time, stated protester Tim Liszewski, as he marched toward Columbia City Hall.
Council participants have given preliminary approval to that deal. Developers say it should take at least a 12 months before the sale is finalized.
The Columbia Blowfish baseball team will be able to play at Capital City Stadium in 2012 if they pick out to do so.
Some developers say finding a baseball stadium on the Bull Street property where the intellectual clinic used to be located would be an eye-catching location.
