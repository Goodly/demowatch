Relations between city, Occupy Portland struggle
Once-cooperative relations between police and Occupy Portland organizers have fallen apart amid allegations that police used excessive pressure when they broke up a downtown camp that protesters had held for 5 weeks.
A protester used to be hospitalized after officers dragged him away, and he now alleges officers beat him. Police say it in no way happened, and he used to be in reality pulled away from a unsafe state of affairs when he fell to the ground between protesters and rebellion police.
Mayor Sam Adams closing week ordered the Occupy Portland encampment shut down. Police on Sunday afternoon cleared out countless dozen demonstrators who remained.
Six demonstrators who had served as liaisons between Occupy Portland, the town and police published an open letter Tuesday announcing they had been giving up their positions due to the fact of police actions.
