DATELINE: TACOMA Wash.


The last 5 or six Occupy Tacoma demonstrators completed packing up Monday morning and cleared out of Pugnetti Park.
The land is owned through the country Transportation Department, which posted eviction notices Thursday because of legal responsibility issues. About 20 people had been camping there since October.
The Tacoma campers left peacefully, in contrast to Occupy demonstrators who clashed with police in other cities.
One, Cameron Ruba, proudly carried an eviction word he had signed through Transportation Department people and State Patrol troopers with "best wishes." He says campers have been treated civilly so they dealt civilly with the request to leave.
Another camper, Bret Johnson, stated Occupy Tacoma would proceed to have weekly meetings.
Three others headed for the bus station, planning to head south to join Occupy San Diego.
