Police are making arrests at the Bank of America Plaza where some Occupy Wall Street sympathizers have set up tents.
Police announced quickly earlier than 4 p.m. that protesters had 15 minutes to pack up their tents and go away the plaza area or face arrest.
About 27 protesters linked hands and stood in a circle with police in rise up equipment nearby. So a long way eight humans have been taken into custody barring incident.
The march, which has been peaceful, started out quickly after midday Thursday at the Occupy LA encampment at City Hall.
Three human beings were arrested previously when the crowd spilled off the sidewalk and into the street.
