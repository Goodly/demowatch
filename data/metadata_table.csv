372,0,"Occupy Wall Street supporters gather in Albany

By Steve Lathrop, Albany Democrat-Herald



Brandishing homemade signs and waving at passing  cars, more than 60 people supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement lined up  in downtown Albany late Friday afternoon to deliver their message.
About five counter-demonstrators were also on hand with signs asking for relief of their tax burden and occasionally debating with individuals from the larger group.
The demonstration was peaceful and larger than Edith Orner, one of the organizers, expected.
“I thought we would get 50 so this is good,” she said.
One of those on hand was Nancy Rose-Chism of Albany.
“A lot of people here are retired, or unemployed or students,” she said, “but I’m not any of those. I wanted to lend my voice to taking back our money and our government.”
Rose-Chism said she was looking for a way to be a part of the growing movement and turned to the Internet.
“I searched for an Occupy Albany site and found this,” she said. “I’m one of the 99 percent.”
So she made her own sign and joined the rally.
According to Orner, many people found out about the demonstration the same way. She said the idea got started among a small group of people who meet once a week. About a week ago they decided to do something in support of the Occupy movements.
“We just said let’s get on that and we put something together as quickly as we could,” Orner said.
That meant placing posters around Albany, and using social networking, emails and the telephone.
It seemed to work. By 5 p.m. the crowd had swelled to almost 70.
Those at the rally lined up on all four corners of Fourth and Ellsworth showing their signs to passing traffic and pedestrians. Orner said the idea was to demonstrate for about an hour.
“Our concern is what’s going on with the economy,” she said. “We don’t want to reduce the deficit on the backs of those who need (the money) most.”
Rose-Chism said she wanted to be part of something that was trying to make things better for the majority of the people.
“I believe this is what most of the people want,” she said.
No plans for additional demonstrations are in the works now, but that could change.
“We may have a follow-up discussion of some sort,” Orner said. “We want to be part of doing what we can for the greater good.”

Occupy Albany protesters move from park to Capitol

DATELINE: ALBANY N.Y.


Dozens of Occupy Albany protesters, young and old, entered New York's Capitol on Thursday demanding a millionaire's tax in the state.
Security guards asked the group to stop chanting while they asked questions and then let them into the building's public space.
The demonstrators have been calling for higher taxes on the wealthy, something opposed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Senate Republican majority. Thursday's rally is part of the nationwide movement blaming Wall Street and the government for economic woes and policies favoring the rich, or about 1 percent of Americans.
Some Albany protesters have been camped in a nearby park since Friday, where the initial Occupy Albany demonstration was held.
Protester Michael Fisk said more than 50 were headed to Cuomo's office in the Capitol. The Albany Law School student said the march is a symbolic effort.
The governor, who was in New York City, had no immediate comment.
""We're not trying to do anything illegal here,"" said Trudy Quaif, 58, a protester from suburban Albany. ""Gov. Cuomo is not paying attention.""
Quaif, who is retired, said the state needs to tax earners of more than $1 million a year at a higher rate to pay for infrastructure improvements and better schools in order to attract more jobs and business.
Signs in the Capitol included ""Cuomo serves the one percent,"" and ""Tax the Rich.""
Once gathered inside, protesters began chanting: ""We are the 99 percent.""

City leaders defend cops for Occupy Albany actions, but protesters say trust is gone
By JORDAN CARLEO-EVANGELIST, Staff writer
Updated 10:42 pm, Friday, December 23, 2011


ALBANY — On the matted, dead grass of Academy Park — where the lively Occupy Albany camp held court for eight weeks — only disappointment reigned Friday.
Disappointment by protesters still furious over what they say was excessive force wielded a day earlier by a police department whose leader, Chief Steven Krokoff, they had previously viewed as their principled protector.
And disappointment by Krokoff and other top city officials, who criticized the lack of respect shown by demonstrators and lamented having being drawn into the exact sort of physical conflict with the protesters they had sought for two months to avoid.
Krokoff and Mayor Jerry Jennings stridently backed the actions of their officers in the bizarre tug of war Thursday over the encampment's last remaining tent — a scrum that ended with three officers injured and several members of the crowd, including a city councilman, reeling from pepper spray used by one mounted officer.
""Use of that pepper spray most definitely prevented serious injuries — not only to the police officers but to the other people that were in that camp,"" Krokoff said Friday morning, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Mayor Jerry Jennings. ""I'm proud of each and every member of my police department — as proud as I've ever been of them — for the work that they've done. ...the abuse that they took.""
Richard Gorleski, the officer who used the pepper spray, later confirmed Krokoff's account of the incident, saying he reacted only after protesters reached for the reins and bridle of his horse.
""If I didn't spray a few of those people, someone would have been seriously injured,"" said Gorleski, who is also president of the Albany Police Officers Union. He said officers below him were being rushed by protesters trying to keep police from restraining those clinging to the tent.
Some protesters, however, disputed that account.
Jennings, meanwhile, contrasted the city's decision to send crews of workers into Academy Park to dismantle the two-month-old encampment after its permit expired Thursday with tactics used elsewhere.
""I didn't go in the middle of the night like they did in other cities,"" he said. ""They did show restraint.""
Krokoff's refusal to arrest the protesters after the camp first took root Oct. 21 — paired with District Attorney David Soares ' refusal to prosecute them — only boosted the chief's credibility among progressives who backed his candidacy for the job last year. That he was at the center of its unraveling served as a strange coda to the Occupy Albany encampment.
""I no longer trust Krokoff,"" declared Councilman Anton Konev, a one-time supporter of the chief.
Konev has called for hearings to investigate the use of force and said using some of the city's new beat officers to dismantle the camp may have seriously damaged newly forged relationships with the community.
Councilman Dominick Calsalaro, who said he was grazed by the mist of pepper spray, also criticized the decision to capture the tent but laid the blame with Jennings, not Krokoff, who he said was likely just following orders.
""It was totally against the whole community policing philosophy, and they've destroyed relationships that they've had with the people,"" Calsolaro said. ""Nobody disrespected the police until they came in to take that tent.""
City workers first entered the camp around 2 p.m. Thursday after officials won a court order barring the occupiers from continuing to spend nights there.
But the violence didn't flare until some three hours later, after the protesters uprooted their last tent and carried it around the city through rush-hour traffic, then returned it to the park across Washington Avenue from the state Capitol.
Protesters maintained they had no plans to leave it there. Minutes later, however, about 30 police officers under orders from Krokoff moved in to capture it to prevent them from heading back into the streets.
Mark Mishler an attorney working with the protesters, called that the day's most fateful decision, saying that if the protesters were going to resist, they would have done so hours earlier when they linked arms and surrounded the tent before taking to the streets.
""The group had already essentially made a decision that they weren't going to fight to keep it in the park,"" Mishler said.
The hand-to-hand struggle that ensued — including the use of the pepper spray — was captured on numerous video recordings. Police first said only two protesters were sprayed, but Krokoff later acknowledged more may have been hit.
Four people were arrested, and three police officers suffered minor injuries, Krokoff said, including one who was hospitalized overnight for complications resulting from a back injury.
Soares said his office will review video of the skirmish to decide whether to prosecute those arrested. In a statement, he called the conflict a ""black eye"" for the city. But Jennings put the blame squarely on the protesters.
""I expected cooperation. We didn't get it,"" Jennings said, reiterating that the occupiers are free to return to the park, so long as they leave their camping gear behind. ""We're not going to allow it. We'll take 'em down again.""

Protesters can stay in Atlanta park until Monday
BYLINE: By ERRIN HAINES, Associated Press
SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL
LENGTH: 413 words
DATELINE: ATLANTA


Mayor Kasim Reed will allow Occupy Atlanta protesters to remain in a downtown park until Monday.
Reed issued an executive order Wednesday at 5 p.m. allowing the Occupy Atlanta demonstrators to remain legally in Woodruff Park until the adjournment of the Atlanta City Council meeting on Monday, according to the mayor's office. The demonstrators have been in the park illegally for the past 6 days, in violation of a city ordinance. 
""As mayor, I am proud of the city of Atlanta's heritage as the birthplace of the civil rights movement,"" Reed said in a statement released by his office. ""At the same time, I am committed to protecting the public and ensuring that the laws of the city are respected. I will not allow public safety to be jeopardized in any way by the protesters. So far, all of their actions have been peaceful and nonviolent.""
The situation has created a quandary for city officials and police who have asked them to leave. The city has not enforced the ordinance, allowing the protesters to remain.
Occupy Atlanta spokesman Tim Franzen said he was happy to hear of the executive order, but that they would not be deterred and plan to hold their ground.
""We're in a position right now where we feel like either way, we're doing what we need to do,"" Franzen told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ""When we get evicted, there will be people who will put their bodies on the line nonviolently and go to jail.""
Franzen said King's legacy has also factored into his strategy, and that the Atlanta protest is different from those in other parts of the country.
""We're in Martin Luther King's backyard,"" he said. ""Our leaders learned decades ago that we can't afford to brutalize protesters here.""
The Occupy Atlanta protesters left the park briefly Tuesday to march to the Atlanta headquarters of Bank of America. The group swelled to nearly 200 at the bank plaza.
The protests are part of a growing national movement opposing corporate greed and other ills. About 50 protesters in Boston were arrested Monday night when they ignored warnings to move from a downtown greenway near where they have been camped out for more than a week, according to police. Several hundred protesters were arrested in New York more than a week ago after police said they ignored warnings to stay in place.
The park closes to the public at 11 p.m. under city law. The code is intended to keep homeless people from sleeping in parks, but has ensnared the otherwise peaceful protesters.

Curtis Compton, ccompton@ajc.com A group of more than 100 calling themselves Occupy Atlanta protesters set up a barricade around their tent city as they gathered in Woodruff Park in Atlanta on Monday, Oct. 10, 2011.




""We will occupy this park at the cost of being arrested and put into jail,"" a spokesman for the group said at an 11 a.m. news conference. ""We will not commit any acts of violence.""
The ""occupation"" was in its sixth day Wednesday with no sign that police were preparing to take any action.
Police maintained only a low-key presence, both at the park and during a late afternoon march to the Midtown offices of the Bank of America, which drew about 50 people from the park and perhaps 100 who joined en route. By 5:30 p.m., the marchers had dispersed, with some heading back to the park trailed by about six police officers on motorcycles.
Robert Derenthal, 21, of Marietta, a student at Kennesaw State, told the AJC Wednesday he had been at the protest since Saturday in the hopes that ""others will start to make their voices known about the abusive practices of Wall Street and investment banking and banking throughout this country ... that people need to start to realize there are reasons why we have such high unemployment in this country, underemployment, why people are being thrown out of their homes, why there has been no recovery and it's time for that frustration to get out into the streets.""
Meanwhile, Mayor Kasim Reed told members of the City Council’s public safety committee that, while the city wants to respect the demonstrators’ right to express their views, they cannot be allowed to camp in the park indefinitely.
“This has got to got to come to a close at some point,” Reed said. “At some point, we have to act.”
Reed said the group calling itself Occupy Atlanta is damaging the public park and violating Atlanta’s laws, and to ignore it opens the door to more law-breaking in the future.
“I do worry that we are setting precedents,” Reed said. Giving exemptions to the law “is creating a real problem for us.”
Committee chair Ivory Lee Young Jr. said he appreciated Reed’s concerns, but he suggested that arresting protesters might be unwise.
“Arrests, at this point, don’t serve any of our purposes,” he told Reed during the meeting.
Reed said his staff had conducted a detailed review of how other cities had dealt with the Occupy Wall Street offshoots, and would be ready to brief the City Council on Wednesday.
Boston police made national headlines Tuesday morning by arresting more than 100 protesters who were attempting to expand their encampment from a park to an adjacent roadway greenbelt. Video showed black-clad officers hauling away protesters who chanted, “We are veterans of the United States of America!” An American flag that had apparently been knocked from the hands of one protester lay on the ground as those nearby chanted, “Shame, shame, shame!”
In Atlanta, meanwhile, a spokesman for Reed said the city will not immediately try to break up the protesters’ encampment, which on Tuesday afternoon numbered about 30 tents. “As long as they’re there peacefully, for the time time being, we’re going to allow them to stay,” said Reese McCranie, the mayor’s deputy director of communications. “That may change in the future or may not change.”
One camper applauded the decision. “I think it’s great,” said Phil Aliff, 25, a student at Kennesaw State University. “I hope they let us stay here indefinitely. Our side can win if we continue to bring people out.”
Occupy Atlanta, rallying against corporate greed and the war in Afghanistan, set up stakes in the park Friday night. The crowd’s size varied through the weekend.
Reed said the protesters have presented him with a list of demands. They want the park renamed for Troy Anthony Davis, the man executed last month for murdering a Savannah police officer. Second, the protesters want Reed to camp with them overnight in the park. Third, they want assurances that they won’t be arrested.
Reed said he was praying about whether he should sleep in the park. But he refused to give assurances that no one would be arrested.
As for renaming Woodruff Park? “That’s not going to happen,” Reed said.

380,557,"Mayor: Reports Wrong, Occupy Atlanta Can Stay for Now
Posted: Oct 22, 2011 5:14 PM PDT


The mayor’s office is refuting media reports it has issued an ultimatum for members of the Occupy Atlanta to leave Woodruff Park on Saturday evening.
The reports state that the group known as Occupy Atlanta, which has been allowed to stay in Woodruff Park for the past few weeks by way of executive order sign by Mayor Kasim Reed, was now being told to leave the park immediately.
A spokesperson for Mayor Reed called the reports ""dead wrong"" and told FOX 5 in a phone interview around 8 p.m. on Saturday that the orders to allow the protest group to stay in the park still stands.
Despite the claims, there was a noticeable increase in the number of officers in the area after the city said they were forced to shutdown a planned hip hop festival. City representatives said the festival did not obtain all the proper permits and could not continue as a result. They also would not allow the festival to be folded into the executive orders which pertain to Occupy Atlanta.",1,Atlanta,2011-10-22

Mayor working to find Occupy Atlanta solution
ATLANTA — 


Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed's office says he will determine the next step once his executive order allowing the Occupy Atlanta protestors to stay in Woodruff Park expires Monday night. That order gives demonstrators the ability to remain in the downtown park after 11 p.m.  Under that order, protestors must remove their tents by 5 p.m. Monday and vacate the park by 11 p.m. The office said earlier Friday that the expiration of that order was never meant to be a hard deadline, but added once that time comes, Mayor Reed will reevaluate the situation and make his final determination.
This comes after Occupy Atlanta 's leader, Tim Franzen, told Channel 2's Richard Elliot that they had no plans to leave the park by 11 p.m. Monday.
 ""We will be ready for non-violent civil disobedience,"" said Franzen.  ""We have commitments from specific civil rights leaders to stand here with us, to sit d own and link arms, and to be dragged off and sent to jail if that's what the mayor wants.""
The city hopes to avoid the kind of violent confrontations seen in New York  City where police officers and demonstrators clashed in the streets in full view of cameras.  NYPD officers and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg came under criticism for their handling of the situation.
Franzen told Elliot he believed Monday was a hard deadline and was determined to remain in the park past it.  Still, he invited Mayor Reed to come down and talk with the demonstrators.
""We'd love to have his support,"" he said.  ""We'd love to have his endorsement.  We think the voices that we're trying to lift up are the voices of his constituents.""
The group marched Friday evening from the park to a homeless shelter on Peachtree and Pine streets, blocking traffic on the downtown streets.
Some of Occupy Atlanta 's neighbors are also growing frustrated with the demonstrations, and told Elliot they would like to see the city move in and shut them down.
 ""It's really annoying,"" said Katelyn Caccavale, who lives across the street from Woodruff Park.  ""Our walls are paper thin, so every night, we hear them screaming and yelling and banging their bongos.""
 Maryam Ahmed works downtown and said she supports the protests and the mayor's decision not to move in.
 ""I'm glad they're out here,"" she said.  "" I believe in the movement all across America.""
 No word when the mayor will make a decision whether to extend that executive order to allow the protestors to remain.
As Occupy Atlanta 's occupation of Woodruff Park enters its second week, no one is exactly sure how much the demonstrations are costing Atlanta's taxpayers, though APD admits it is costing something.
In an emailed received by Elliot, Atlanta Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it was just too early to tell the exact expenditures.  But he confirmed it is costing taxpayers some money.
""There is no question that providing police presence to properly ensure public safety surrounding the Occupy Atlanta movement requires an increased expenditure of resources and funding,"" said Campos.
But Campos went on to say Atlanta Police are well equipped to handle this demonstration, because it has a lot of experience handling large scale events.
""The Atlanta Police Department routinely handles large-scale events, much larger in fact, than these protests,"" he said.
""On any given weekend, there are hundreds of thousands of people in the city of Atlanta for professional and collegiate sports, trade shows, conventions, festivals, and cultural and artistic events.  Before any event that requires additional APD presence, the department evaluates the resources required for the event and for city-wide coverage.  The department is performing this same evaluation regarding Occupy Atlanta and planning ahead for the indefinite duration of the protest.""
 Campos also ensured that APD will continue to provide for public safety across the rest of the city.",1,Atlanta,2011-10-14

Reed extends order allowing Occupy Atlanta protestors
By Richard Elliot
ATLANTA — 


Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has extended his executive order allowing Occupy Atlanta protestors to remain in Woodruff Park through early November. Reed's earlier order would have expired at 11 p.m. Monday meaning protestors would have had to dismantle their tents immediately and vacate the grounds once the park closed.
In a statement Reed said, "" Civil disobedience is an appropriate form of expression, provided that it is peaceful, non-violent and lawful.  As of today, the Occupy Atlanta protesters continue to assemble in a peaceful, non-violent fashion in Robert W. Woodruff Park. Therefore, I have extended the Executive Order allowing Occupy Atlanta to remain in Woodruff Park after the park closes.  This Executive Order is effective through the adjournment of the next Atlanta City Council meeting on November 7, 2011.""
 Earlier in the day, about 40 Occupy Atlanta protestors marched down Peachtree Street for a rally in support of struggling downtown businesses.
 At that rally, Channel 2's Richard Elliot asked the protest leaders what would happen if that executive order expired.
 ""We are ready to get arrested,"" said Occupy Atlanta's Tim Franzen.  ""We never asked for permission to occupy the park.  It's an illegal occupation, and we're not moving.""
 The Atlanta City Council met Monday but did not take up the occupation issue, its unclear what will happen in November.  Councilman Ivory Young Jr., who supports the national Occupy movement, chastised local protestors for what he sees as a lack of direction.
 ""We're preoccupied with this whole notion of are we going to arrest or not,"" said Young.  ""How about the whole premise of Occupy (Atlanta)?  We sit here day after day and talk about will we or won't we arrest.  How about the premise of some salient points that help to frame that agenda?""
Even Occupy Atlanta protestors say they are demonstrating against a number of things, everything from economic inequities to corporate greed to the potential closing of the Pine Street homeless shelter to struggling downtown businesses.
Reed added in his statement that the city will keep a watchful eye on the protestors.
""The Executive Order does not preclude the city from responding at will to changing conditions in the park or to any public safety issues. The city is prepared to act swiftly should the situation in the park so warrant,"" the statement said.",1,Atlanta,2011-10-17
383,696,"Occupy Austin protests cost taxpayers thousands
by STEVE ALBERTS / KVUE News
November 7, 2011 at 5:40 PM


AUSTIN -- It has been almost five weeks since Occupy Austin protesters took up residence outside Austin City Hall.
On Monday, KVUE News learned just how much the protest is costing taxpayers.
Since Oct. 6, an average four to eight officers have been assigned to the Occupy Austin protest for 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Officers have been pulled off of their beats and are working overtime at a cost of more than a quarter of a million dollars.
Since the beginning of the protest, it has cost taxpayers more than $207,000. Some city leaders question the cost. The Public Safety Commission plans to discuss the protest during its Monday meeting.
""Those are big dollar amounts in any year but in a year when businesses are down, sales taxes are down, property values are dropping, that is a very heavy burden for the city to pay and ultimately those of us who live in the city,"" Chair of the Public Safety Commission Michael Lauderdale said.
Protesters disagree and argue that the cost is justified.
""If we want to talk about where we are wasting the money, it is not Austin protesters, it's the government and the ridiculous laws we have in place,"" Deitrich Holgate said.
Austin police say there have been 71 arrests made since the start of Occupy Austin. Most are for criminal trespassing. Other arrests include warrants, aggravated sexual assault and disorderly conduct.
According to Occupy Austin's website, the protesters plan on occupying City Hall for another month.",1,Austin,2011-11-07

Social media helps social movement grow

The show: Occupy Austin
The scene: Early evening on a recent weekday at Austin City Hall
The cast: More than 150 college kids, business owners, teachers, homeless people, waiters and so on
The plot: Motley crew of protesters tries to run a meeting. Chaos ensues.
Bonus plot: The whole thing unfolds on social media
Nobody said running an occupation was easy. From the gay rights movement to the Vietnam War protests, the messy task of trying to change the world has been well-documented in books, movies, scholarly papers and academic research.
But these days, people don't have to wait for the postgame commentary. Thanks to social media, they can watch every detail of the Wall Street protests unfold for themselves. Occupy Austin is, in a way, a reality show produced by Facebook, Twitter, Livestream, blogs, Google groups and email. And what viewers are seeing ranges from high drama and fierce divisions to hard work and unexpected kindness.
Whether Occupy protests go boom or bust, one thing is clear: Trying to pull off a social movement is a complicated, time-consuming, often-frustrating business.
""It's a wonderful process,"" said Sylvia Benini , one of Occupy Austin's organizers. ""It's like the birth of a child. It has to grow.""
Episode 1: Coming together
The scene: Late morning on a weekday at a small warehouse in East Austin
The cast: About a dozen volunteers, ranging in age from teens to middle-aged
The plot: Protesters gather at headquarters to eat, sleep and handle logistical issues.
Base camp for Occupy Austin is a borrowed building cluttered with tools, tents, battered furniture, old computer monitors, bedding and more. A makeshift kitchen houses a sink, a counter and a mini-refrigerator. A small room at the front of the warehouse serves as the computer center, and another stores food donations.
""We've spent $50 on food,"" said volunteer Chris Nielsen , a 32-year-old Austin man who owns a golf cart taxi company. ""Whatever we need, we just put it out on Twitter or Facebook, and it just appears.""
Occupy Austin is one of hundreds of spinoffs from Occupy Wall Street, an ongoing protest in New York City that opposes, among other things, corporate money in politics and the growing wealth gap. Since the New York rallies began Sept. 17, protests have spread to more than 1,500 cities across the nation and world, including Paris and Rome .
Protesters complain about different things, but their core belief is generally the same: Government favors the rich and oppresses the middle class and poor.
""It's always the little guy that gets stepped on,"" Nielsen said.
The Austin movement began to gel Sept. 29 , when about 500 people flocked to the coffeehouse Ruta Maya on South Congress Avenue to talk about the protests. Volunteers spent the next week planning an Oct. 6 rally at City Hall. Work groups, or ""magnets,"" tackled city ordinances, food, legal advice, labor union outreach and other details.
There were no official leaders, no president, no board of directors. Proposals came from the magnets and were voted on at the twice-daily general assemblies.
That first protest drew more than 1,000 people. But since then, Occupy Austin's public face has looked a little ragged. During the day at City Hall - where protesters have set up a 24/7 occupation - signs generally outnumber people.
But a closer look at the movement shows more. About 100 people regularly show up for general assemblies. More than 1,000 people participated Saturday in a march to Chase Bank.
Occupy Austin's website, which the U.S. Library of Congress has decided to archive with its Internet materials on public policy topics, has gotten more than 1.1 million hits.
Its Facebook page has more than 14,000 followers. It is developing an online radio station.
And unlike many other groups, including Occupy Wall Street itself, Occupy Austin has a concrete list of demands for the government, such as limits on corporate contributions to political campaigns and tax reform so ""corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes.""
""This thing is coming together,"" said Occupy Austin member Peter Morales , a general contractor participating in the protest. ""It's evolving every day.""
Episode 2
Nuts and bolts
The scene: The general assembly on a recent weeknight at Austin City Hall
The cast: Harried facilitator, angry poet, sacred prayer lady, more than 100 protesters
The plot: Calm meeting quickly spins out of control
The light was fading, but tempers were rising.
A meeting that had begun with a rational discussion about future events morphed into an argument over police oppression.
An angry poet grabbed the microphone to vent. A woman stood up to sing a sacred prayer. A competing group crooned a different song. The meeting facilitator succumbed to the chaos.
""I think that this meeting cannot be facilitated,"" she said, her voice trailing off.
You didn't have to be there to see it. The whole thing was broadcast on Livestream.com.
Every day, twice a day, Occupy Austin protesters meet on the plaza to discuss their plans for the movement. Until recently, the assemblies had a loose structure that left the agenda to be determined by the group, and that wasn't working, Benini said.
That night, organizers regrouped, switching up the meeting format to committee updates, announcements and an open forum that takes place in smaller groups without a microphone. Since then, meetings have been more constructive, but they are hardly conflict-free.
""You suck!"" one man screamed at a speaker last week. ""Shut up! I am your personal heckler!""
Similar divisions have erupted online. In one recent incident on the Occupyaustin.org forums, someone posted an angry exchange between two people. The site moderator deleted it, generating fierce criticism.
""That thread should not have been deleted!!"" one person wrote. ""I just posted on it and we were all voicing our opinions and in no way should it have been deleted. THAT IS GOING TO DIVIDE US!!!""
Censorship has been a recurring theme of complaints. Critics charge that Facebook posts questioning the movement regularly disappear.
Anton Montoya, who works for a local e-commerce business and is a member of Occupy Austin's Web team, said organizers are not deleting anything off Facebook and missing posts have likely been removed by the spam filter.
Moderators are, however, deleting posts off Occupy austin.org that the Web team deems hate speech or personal attacks.
""We will not allow that on the pages we are responsible for,"" Benini said. ""That is called being responsible to our community.""
Austin isn't the only area to face such conflicts. Earlier this week, news stories detailed arguments within Occupy Wall Street in New York over issues such as diversity and strategy. And though things have improved, Occupy Houston's early demonstrations were frozen when participants argued so much that they couldn't decide where to march, said member Joshua Pineda, 25, a Houston resident who recently joined the Austin effort.
""The inexperience was massive amongst our ranks,"" he said.
All of this, experts say, is typical of social movements. Friction is natural when trying to organize large groups of people, all of whom have their own perspectives and agendas.
The consequences of that friction vary, said Amin Ghaziani , an assistant professor in the sociology department of the University of British Columbia.
It can hurt recruitment or spur the creation of splinter groups, he said. It also leaves the movement vulnerable to a ""divide and conquer"" strategy by critics and the media who might seek to dilute the group's message, he said.
Series finale
or renewal?
But it's not all bad news.
""On the other hand, groups that are subjected to intense scrutiny and negative publicity often band together very tightly, clarify their message, and end up with a unit that is actually more cohesive because of the attention others pay to its internal disputes,"" Ghaziani said.
The diversity of opinions within the group has also brought a diversity of resources, like business owners offering free food, welders building makeshift showers outside base camp and lawyers providing free legal advice. Many of the occupiers have developed strong friendships cultivated by working together 12 to 14 hours a day.
""I see people growing and respecting each other more and more,"" said Ellis McClane , a 19-year-old online book seller. ""It's a beautiful thing.""
And so, for now, Occupy Austin is still writing new episodes for itself.
Whether the movement can continue to move forward is an open question. But Occupiers aren't going anywhere, said Tom Friedley, a 53-year-old radio broadcaster volunteering for the effort.
""Right now, we're just going through growing pains,"" he said. ""If this was easy, people would have done it by now.""

New York
The global movement began here Sept. 17, when hundreds of people protested against Wall Street  profits in  Manhattan . About 150 people  stayed overnight in Zuccotti Park, a privately owned public space near Wall Street. Protesters have since sponsored  rallies and marches addressing financial inequity and other issues. More than 700 have been arrested as of Oct. 15.
Washington
Occupy D.C. began Oct. 1 in McPherson Square, about two blocks from the White House. Some participants  clashed with police Oct. 8, which prompted the closure of the National Air and Space Museum. Occupy organizers said they've scaled back daily protests and have begun to hold 'teach-ins' on government corruption and money in politics.
Seattle
On the West Coast, Seattle protesters have occupied Westlake Park and City Hall Plaza since late September; hundreds were routed and eight were arrested in the city Monday  after defying the city's ban on tents in public parks. At least 3,000 people marched Saturday  to Pike Place Market, where 200 sat down  on First Avenue and blocked traffic for about 10 minutes. Other Occupy protests

Morgan Taheny (left) and her mom, Kara Taheny, join Occupy Bangor protesters at Peirce Park in Bangor on Saturday, Nov. 5, 2011 for family day. The small group sang songs and did face paintings.
                        
BANGOR, Maine — Three-year-old Morgan Taheny of Bangor danced as her mother, stepfather and grandfather sang along with some 20 Occupy Bangor demonstrators gathered Saturday to celebrate a day for kids and families.
On Morgan’s right cheek was a red heart and on her left was a butterfly, both painted by Sunny Hughes, a spokeswoman for Occupy Bangor.
Behind the girl, propped up against the statue in Peirce Park, signs read “Make jobs, not war,” “I don’t like things that are unfair,” or “Dissent is Patriotic.”
“Get a job, you (expletives),” a man shouted from a car as it traveled up Center Street hill behind the library.
A few demonstrators waved at the driver. Morgan didn’t seem to take notice and danced on.
The singing continued, with folk classics and well known children’s songs, such as “Baby Beluga,” and “Shake Your Sillies Out.”
Off to the side, standing near a fire to stay warm, Shawn Yardley, director of the city of Bangor’s Department of Health and Community Services, and his 13-year-old daughter Kira looked on and listened to the music.
“I wanted her to have a chance to see what’s going on,” Yardley said, adding that it was important for him, personally, to see what people in Bangor are talking about.
Kira said her social studies class at All Saints Catholic School has been talking about the Occupy demonstrations.
Kira said she has never spent the night in a tent, and asked her dad if they could bring a tent down to the grounds and brave the cold for a night during the demonstration.
Shawn Yardley said he’d think about it.
“We haven’t learned a lot about (the Occupy demonstrations), but that’s why I came down here,” Kira said.
That’s the purpose of the family day, Hughes said. It gives kids a chance to see the protest firsthand, and gives parents a way of explaining to their kids what the Occupy movement is about, she said.
Hughes said she explained Occupy Bangor to her son by saying, “the reason that I (demonstrated) is so that I could look him in the eye when he’s older and say I did everything I could.”
At noon, some demonstrators were scheduled to take a bus to Augusta to join Occupy protesters there for a march on the State House.
The group will then return and maintain its presence outside the library. About six demonstrators consistently stay at the site overnight in tents set up on the grounds.
“It’s very cold, but we encourage people to give (sleeping in tents outside) a shot,” she said.
Hughes said the demonstrators plan on an “indefinite occupation,” and that she hopes more people come out to join Occupy Bangor and show support for the week-old movement, in spite of the cold.
Hughes’ 10-year-old son Skyler was on hand for family day, joining in on the songs.
During a break in the music, he said he spends weekends during the day at Occupy Bangor, and sometimes stops by after school during the week if there aren’t any other activities scheduled after the final bell.
He said kids at school are curious about the protests, and that some have asked him why demonstrators haven’t given up.
“I think we shouldn’t give up,” Skyler said, “because if we just give up, nothing’s ever going to change.”

About 70 people carried signs and chanted slogans through the downtown streets Saturday as part of an Occupy Baton Rouge rally.
With his 10-month-old daughter, Twyla, sleeping in a tummy carrier, organizer Chris Chemel, of Baton Rouge, yelled out the cadence: “Banks got bailed out. We got sold out.”
The crowd marched past the closed main offices of Capital One and Chase banks. Downtown Baton Rouge was largely empty, except for patrons watching the LSU-Auburn football game on the television sets in bars and restaurants.
Chemel said that large multi-national banks have set policies that hurt working people. He urged customers to close their accounts at the large financial institutions and, instead, do business with local banks and credit unions.
Carrying signs reading, “Not everyone can be CEO” and “I’ll believe corporations are people when Texas executes a corporation,” the group marched past the LSU Shaw Center for the Arts to the levee by the USS Kidd Veterans Memorial & Museum. Some workers came out of their businesses to watch the procession and wave.
The Occupy Wall Street protests, which began in New York two months ago, have spread to cities around the world.
In London, a group calling itself Occupy London Stock Exchange camped outside the Cathedral of St. Paul, leading church officials to shut down the famous landmark. Also on Saturday, about 4,000 marched on the streets of Frankfurt, Germany, protesting banking policies of German financial institutions, according to news reports.
Protesters at these events, generally, have questioned the fairness of government and corporate policies that financially help businesses that continue to lay off workers, increase prices and balk at paying more taxes.
Similar “Occupy” protests have been held in Lafayette, New Orleans and Shreveport. This was the first such event in Baton Rouge.
Bruce Blaney, of Baton Rouge, was among the 125 who gathered at the State Capitol prior to the march. He attended a similar protest on Oct. 15 by MoveOn.org. He said that while a handful of those attending the Occupy rally on Saturday were at the MoveOn event last week, most were not.
After the march, the remaining members returned to the State Capitol and sat on the steps to decide their next move.
Nathan Anderson, an LSU political science major, led the discussion using Robert’s Rules of Order as the group debated how to handle next Saturday’s event.
Occupy Wall Street groups around the nation want to hold simultaneous events at each of the nation’s state capitols on Saturday, Oct. 29. Occupy groups from around Louisiana are planning to come to Baton Rouge, Chemel said.
Local organizers pointed out that the eighth annual Louisiana Book Festival takes place in and around the State Capitol at the same time.
The group on the steps took a vote and a majority decided to move next Saturday’s event to a park near the USS Kidd, rather than disrupt the book festival, Chemel said.
The group also voted to allow some of their number to gather at the park around Huey Long’s grave on Friday to distribute information to people attending the “Live After Five” concert at nearby A.Z. Young Park on Third Street, he said.
Chemel and Bryan Perkins organized Saturday’s Baton Rouge protest through social media such as Facebook. Both said they are not affiliated with other “Occupy” groups. But members of the other groups have been contacting them, Perkins said.
He and Chemel met a couple of weeks of ago when they, independently, started to organize an event in Baton Rouge, Perkins said.
Chemel said he realizes Baton Rouge is a very conservative town and felt his voice was not being heard. Perkins said he had a similar feeling.",1,Baton Rouge,2011-10-24

Police take down tents at Pa. 'Occupy' protest
SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL
LENGTH: 108 words
DATELINE: BETHLEHEM Pa.


Police have evicted protesters who set up tents near a Pennsylvania city hall to demonstrate against corporate greed.
Officials started dismantling the Occupy Bethlehem tents early Thursday morning, nearly a week after city officials told protesters it's illegal to camp in a garden next to the library.
Police Commissioner Jason Schiffer says three people were present when police began tearing down the tents. Schiffer says they gathered personal belongings and left the area.
Authorities say the tents and other personal belongings will be put in storage and released to the owners.
The demonstrators had been camping in Bethlehem since late October.

389,1039,"Occupy Bloomington protesters hold march on anniversary of birth of Occupy Wall Street
By ERIC CUNNINGHAM | IDS
POSTED AT 09:36 PM ON NOV. 17, 2011  (UPDATED AT 02:30 AM ON NOV. 18, 2011)


About 40 members of Occupy Bloomington prepared for the 5 p.m. march.
Inside the tents of Peoples Park, they made sarcastic signs that said such things as “Terrorism Terrorism Terrorism ... Stay scared GO SHOPPING.”
Others watched the live stream of the march in New York. Ray, a former employee of IU and current member of the movement who declined to give his last name, sat alone on a bench, knitting.
“I would like to see the current fiscal fiasco addressed,” Ray said. “This is supposedly a free market economy. But when you bailout banks that should have failed ... well, what does that make you think?”


Ray said conflict of interest was created by the reinterpretation of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1987, which allowed for more connections between lending and investment banks.
“I think that’s partially where things went south into the current situation,” Ray said.
Members of Occupy Bloomington gathered at the Sample Gates to start the protest. They held signs and shouted chants such as “ You are the 99 percent!” and “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out!”


The crowd began to march west on Kirkwood Avenue.


“Everybody pays their tax! Everyone but Goldman Sachs!” they shouted. “You pay taxes, so do we! Everyone except GE!”
The protesters stopped by the old courthouse downtown, and individuals made soap box speeches.
“This day is a day of international solidarity, ” said member Justinian D., who declined to give his last name. “Earlier today I was watching a live stream from Greece (the Occupy movement there). And you know what? They were watching a live stream from New York. How cool is that?”
Another protester, Chris Albert, then took the soap box.


“Why I am here is because we need new ways to relate to each other and relate to the earth,” Albert said.
When Albert stepped down to the crowd he smiled and said, “So you’re quoting me, huh? Well, then say this: Fuck capitalism. It’s a system that forces people to compete with each other and screw each other over in order to survive. ”
Then junior Evan Rocheford took the floor.
“The era of greed is coming to an end,” he said. “We are the evolution. We are the revolution. This earth is shared. This earth is beautiful. Not something to be exploited.”
The march continued around the Courthouse Square downtown.
Walking back to Peoples Park, retired nurse Charlotte Wolff said she had been fighting for rights for 40 years. She protested for civil rights, women’s rights and the end of the Vietnam War.
“The end of the American Dream is when whatever the government gives you, it can take away,” Wolff said.
She said she is proud of Bloomington for this Occupy movement, and she is optimistic about its future.
“It will keep spreading,” she said. “You watch. It’s too big to go away. So let me ask you a question, young man. What do you stand for?”",1,Bloomington,2011-11-18

(NECN: John Moroney, Boston) -


The battle over a sink: it's latest dispute between police and members of Occupy Boston - raising serious questions about where the protest goes from here and how will it end, if ever.
""It's getting a little frustrating,"" said Boston Mayor Tom Menino. ""I want to know what the guidelines are. I wish the judge would give us the guidelines right now about what we can do and what we can't do.""
Protesters at Dewey Square tried Thursday to bring in a stainless steel sink to clean dishes. Officers said the sink was inappropriate and took it away - resulting in a scuffle and creating even more tension between police and protesters.
""The police presence here was ridiculous,"" said protester John Murphy. ""There's no need for that. all that time and money spent for taking away a sink.""
Twenty-five-year-old Gary Williams was arrested and was in court this morning. He allegedly assaulted a police officer during the tussle. Occupy Boston says police overreacted and claims needed items will be brought into camp, even if the city see those items as contraband.
""The city has been very difficult to work with as allowing us to bring in resources that will help us, keep us safe and healthy,"" said Elizabeth Holmes of Occupy Boston.
This latest clash shows that both sides are becoming increasingly restless. Occupy Boston has a restraining order against the city. But a judge is now considering whether the mayor has any legal authority to shut the encampment down.
""I'm the mayor of all the city of Boston and not just a piece of earth in Dewey Square and a couple of hundred folks who probably don't even come from the city of Boston, and I got to make sure that this city works,"" Menino said.",1,Boston,2011-12-02

Occupy Boston takes a page from the radical underground
The Anarchist's Playbook
Just hours after his men finished wiping the Greenway's manicured gardens with the bellies, knees, and faces of Occupy Boston last Tuesday, the BPD top cop attempted to create dissent by blaming a familiar bogeyman: the ""anarchists.""
BPD Commissioner Ed Davis told the BostonHerald on Tuesday that he had no problem with the real protesters. ""The (Occupation) group that was here for the first 10 days was working very closely with us,"" he said, ""but they warned us yesterday morning that a new group, the anarchists, wanted to take control.""
Occupy Boston scoffed at that statement — suggesting that the BPD was using a loaded term to turn public opinion against a nonviolent movement. ""Any 'anarchists' who tried to disrupt the peaceful protests were BPD plants,"" the group tweeted from its official @occupy_boston account. ""Our anarchists linked arms and sang songs. Peacefully.""
In fact, the Occupy movement is deeply rooted in anarchist traditions and values. Many of the national Occupy movement's organizational tools — the lengthy general assemblies, the finger-waggling exercises in consensus-building, the free food and clothing available throughout camp — come from anarchist models of direct action, horizontal organizing, and gift economies.
In Boston specifically, Occupy draws on the experiences of the local direct-action activist community: the anarchists and DIY enthusiasts who have long organized non-hierarchically in collective houses and radical book shops. The current occupation in Dewey Square is ultimately providing a national stage for a fringe population that has espoused these anti-corporate ideals for years. But suddenly — as the protesters chanted to the BPD on Sunday night — ""the whole world is watching.""
Zaina (the activists interviewed asked that we not use their last names) is a 20-year-old BU student who volunteers in Occupy Boston's food tent. She's also a veteran of Food Not Bombs, an international grassroots network of independent groups that serve free vegetarian meals to all comers. Using mostly salvaged food, Food Not Bombs, like Occupy, is distinctly anti-capitalist. Before the Occupation, FNB's focus was on providing two meals a week — one in Central Square, one in Boston Common — mostly to homeless people and traveling kids. Now, Zaina and other FNB regulars work alongside other Occupy volunteers, serving food around the clock to the camp's residents and visitors; they've already fed hundreds.
In the next tent over from food, the ""Really Really Free Market"" offers a space where anyone can drop off unwanted items (mostly clothing) and/or pick up something they need — for free. It's based on the radical anarchist concept of a ""gift economy."" In stark contrast to market economies, there's no expectation of direct compensation for giving. Local collective houses organized RRFMs in Allston's Ringer Park throughout this past summer.
But the influence of anarchist culture on the Occupation goes beyond the notion of a free exchange of goods and services. For good or ill, the interminable, self-involved ""general assemblies"" — something often picked out as a weakness of the Occupy movement — also have their roots in the anarchist underground. It's called ""horizontal organizing,"" decision-making without a command hierarchy or a leader.
""I don't think consensus organizing and horizontal organizing is exclusively anarchist,"" says Jacob, who lives in a cooperative house in lower Allston. ""But it is an idea that we use and love. And I think that it is really addictive. When you participate in a collaborative process, long and slow as it is, at the end . . . every time we pass a decision, the crowd at the GA just roars. Just because we made it, we got through, we heard everybody's voice. And it feels good. . . . It's crazy. And so beautiful.""
As the Occupy movement spreads to dozens of cities, it is bringing with it a new organizational structure that is fundamentally different from the marches and the protests of the Civil Rights era and, later, progressive protests against the Vietnam war.
For anarchists, the Occupy movement is transforming their intrinsic daily practices into tactics utilized by the masses.
""When I go to meetings, we do the twinkles all the time,"" says Zaina, referring to the now-ubiquitous hand gesture that indicates an occupier's support for a given idea. ""And to see hundreds of people doing that now is so great. . . . This has been spread across so many people, you just look around, and you see 200 people doing the twinkles, and it's just so great.""

394,1203,"24 Arrested As Protesters Pack Financial District
Foreclosed Families, Supporters March To Bank Of America
UPDATED 6:06 AM EDT Oct 01, 2011


BOSTON — A group called Occupy Boston took over Dewey Square in Boston Friday night holding a 60s-style sit in.
""It doesn’t look like the politicians are serving the people any more,"" said John, a protestor who would only give his first name. ""They’re serving people with money.""
This is part of nationwide movement that began with a large protest last week on Wall Street.
""We're talking about government reform. We’re talking about finance reform,"" said Nadeem Mazen, from Occupy Boston. ""And we’re opening up a national dialogue as part of a really big issue that’s on so many people’s minds.""
A few blocks away a group called Take Back Boston lead hundreds of people marching from Boston Common to the Financial District.
At 100 Federal Street the protesters gathered at both entrances to the Bank of America building shouting ""We got sold out."" The crowd included dozens of families facing foreclosure.
""The bank took over my property. Tried to evict everybody,"" said Mallerrie McCoy of Dorchester. ""They boarded up my windows. They changed our locks. I?m here to say i?m not going anywhere.""
Antonio Ennis is facing foreclosure on his Dorchester home.
""All we?re asking for is reduce the principal. It?s what?s right,"" Ennis said. ""They got bailed out by us. We need help now. ""
Some 24 protesters were arrested taken from the building in plastic handcuffs as the crowd cheered them on.
""A group went up and purposefully blocked the doors and we asked them to leave,"" said Police Commissioner Ed Davis. ""When they said they didn?t want to and they wanted to be arrested we obliged.""
These individuals choose to ignore the facts and instead focus on increasingly aggressive PR stunts, Bank of America spokesman T.J.Crawford said.
Bank of America has a lot to be proud of in Massachusetts, from modifying 18,000 mortgages since 2008, to lending nearly $400 million to small businesses that are fueling the local economy in the first half of 2011.",1,Boston,2011-10-01

Final EDITION
Occupy gains support after arrests
SECTION: A; Pg. 1
LENGTH: 564  words
 
CHAPEL HILL ? As Occupy Chapel Hill moved from the Peace and Justice Plaza down to Greenbridge Development and back on Thursday night, they were accompanied by the presence of blue lights.
The crowd marched approximately 120 people strong, echoing chants including ""Streets of Chapel Hill beware, Zuccotti Park is everywhere,"" and ""Up with the streets, down with the walls."" Expletives were sprinkled in a few, followed by chants of ""Freedom of speech.""
Occupy Chapel Hill/Carrboro organized the Solidarity March. Liz Reeves, a Chapel Hill resident who has been involved with the group since its creation, said though the turnout was larger than previous events, she wasn't satisfied.
""We can never have enough people,"" she said.
But, more people have been attending the group's daily general assembly meetings following a week of Occupy conflict both on the local and national level. Thursday's march began after that evening's meeting.
Early Tuesday, police in New York City emptied Zuccotti Park of its Occupy Wall Street protestors, sparking questions of censorship and police brutality.
Seven protestors, some of whom had been involved with the Occupy movement, were arrested Sunday on misdemeanor counts of breaking and entering the former Yates Company Motors building on West Franklin Street. Occupy Chapel Hill/Carrboro reaches consensus in its assembly before making any collective actions, and these individuals had not been given consensus. But as guns were wielded, the same questions were raised in Chapel Hill that are being asked of police presence in New York.
""What happened in Zuccotti Park this week made me furious, and I figured this was the night to come out and do something,"" said Drew Lindberg. The march was the first event he's participated in with the Occupy movement.
The group marched down Franklin Street, and looped around on Rosemary, walking in front of and around cars.
Jeremy Westland, a former Chapel Hill resident, had been protesting with Occupy Santa Fe for a month before coming to North Carolina to get involved with Occupy UNC-Greensboro, where he used to be a student. But after seeing the weekend's events, he was inspired to support Chapel Hill's group.
""I think the police cracking down on occupations across the country is building them up more and driving the movement,"" he said. ""People are beginning to see that this is a police state.""
The front of the march included some of those arrested Sunday.
Jeff Clark, Chapel Hill Police Captain, said the police's presence was due to the safety concerns of a large march occurring after dark and disturbing traffic. In addition to the normal downtown officers, the police employed three additional cars for traffic control, Clark said.
""The event went well; the crowd generally stayed on the sidewalks,"" Clark said. ""As long as we get through without any injuries, it's a success. Tonight was very successful.""
Reeves said she believes the police presence was largely due to the fact that the break-in occurred after the group's last march, which she witnessed.
""After being held at gunpoint, I don't think the police are worried about my safety,"" she said.
A march that is not directly related to Occupy Chapel Hill/Carrboro will be held 6 p.m. Monday starting from the Chapel Hill Police Department and going to the Town Council meeting, which will protest police brutality in response to the movements.

At noon, marchers walked from Mall Playground on Columbus Street to Marion Square as well as Meeting and King Street.

Latest developments in the global Occupy protests

LENGTH: 469 words
 
Some of the latest developments in the Occupy protests taking place in cities across the world:
LONDON
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside St. Paul's Cathedral over the weekend. Many have since hunkered down outside the cathedral, pitching tents and setting up a makeshift kitchen, toilets and an information center. Until now, church staff members have allowed the protesters to remain. But in a statement released late Wednesday, St. Paul's said that the ""increased scale and nature"" of the camp could make it more difficult for the cathedral to stay open for worshippers and tourists.
NEW YORK
A plainclothes police officer who's becoming known as the ""hipster cop"" for his fashion sense says he thinks his rising profile helps ""break down a lot of walls."" Detective Rick Lee, 45, has been the subject of much Internet chatter for showing up at Zuccotti Park for his work as a community affairs officer wearing narrow ties, cardigan sweaters and thick-framed glasses.
Rainy weather put a damper on the protests Wednesday, with demonstrators huddled under tarps. A couple of die-hards stood in the downpour holding up American flags and wearing gas masks.
SOUTH CAROLINA
Charleston is known for its Southern hospitality. Now it's playing host to the region's newest ""Occupy"" protests. Occupy Charleston got a permit to stay at a city park beginning Wednesday, and about 30 people showed up. The permit allows groups of up to 49 people to protest outside City Hall, banks and other locations. If the crowds were bigger, the marches would require a city parade permit.
CALIFORNIA
Sacramento police say nine protesters associated with the Occupy Wall Street movement were arrested at downtown's Cesar Chavez Park on suspicion of being there after hours and failing to disperse. City officials had refused to grant a permit allowing them to remain in the park overnight. Laura Peck, police spokeswoman in the California capital city, said the nine were among about 100 people demonstrating; the other protesters complied with police orders to leave. Sacramento police have now arrested around 70 people.
NORTH CAROLINA
Police in Asheville arrested four people for washing windows. Protester Amy Hamilton said she and nine other demonstrators were cleaning up the Merrill Lynch building when four were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of trespassing. About 200 people have participated in Asheville, a city in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina.
OHIO
Some demonstrators marched to a Cincinnati City Council meeting to voice concern over what they said were some leaders' apparent opposition to the protest. The group also wants the city to change its rule banning people from a downtown park after closing hours. A federal judge on Tuesday had ordered a temporary stop to the police ticketing of the protesters.

CHARLESTON, SC (WCSC) -
Nine protesters who were arrested following an Occupy Charleston demonstration Tuesday night are set to be released on Wednesday on a personal recognizance bond.
Another protester who was arrested at the demonstration is being held due to two active bench warrants.
A judge also gave a condition in the protesters' bond that states that they cannot go back to protest at Marion Square until the case is resolved.


Charleston City Police arrested 10 people just after midnight Wednesday at Marion Square in downtown Charleston.
About 30 protesters of the Occupy Charleston movement stood their ground at Marion Square, voicing their concerns with corporate America and the American economy. About 40 to 50 police officers watched on.
Justin Robert Honea was charged with prohibited activity in a public park. Nine other people were arrested on trespassing charges. Their names are below.
Protesters were told by Mayor Joe Riley on Monday that they were not allowed to occupy Marion Square after the park closed at 11 p.m. Riley told the protesters they could stay in the park for seven days and only during daylight hours, but the protesters weren't happy.
Occupiers took to the streets Tuesday night in a last-ditch effort, to raise awareness about social and economic inequality, turning a peaceful park into a restless one.
According to a spokesperson for the City of Charleston, protesters for Occupy Charleston addressed the city council Tuesday during a 30-minute open forum to the public. Supposedly, nothing came out of that meeting.
The occupy movement has cost local taxpayers nationwide at least $13 million since the protests began, according to an associated press survey. The survey looked at data from government agencies in 18 cities with active protests through Nov. 15. Most of the costs come from law enforcement needing to monitor marches and evict protesters.

Occupy protesters vow to defy Charleston's request to leave
By Travis Crum


CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Protesters aligned with the Occupy Wall Street movement said Friday they would defy Charleston's request to halt overnight camping at the capital city's Davis Park.
Josh Dolin, a protester from South Charleston, said power was cut off to the park Friday evening. The protesters would not have a power supply for heaters when temperatures begin to drop to freezing this weekend, he said.
Dolin said it's an effort by the city to push the 30 or so protesters out of the park, where they have been assembled for more than two weeks.
""Most of us are from the mountains,"" Dolin said. ""We can rough it.""
Charleston mayoral assistant Rod Blackstone said the protesters were told last week their stay at the park could not be permanent.
""It's just not sustainable,"" he said. ""Having an encampment there for the next several months is not an option.""
Blackstone also said the protesters were told last week that the power would be cut off because Davis Park is not meant to be supplied with power 24 hours a day.
He said the city wants the protesters to stay in the park only during the day and that they leave before nightfall.
Dolin said the protesters have no plans of leaving the site and will remain there ""as long as it takes.""
The protesters are assembled at the site in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street movement that started in New York City in September. Every state has had an Occupy movement, according to the movement's official website.
Protesters across the country say they represent the ""99 percent"" of the American people suffering because of the economic policies of the wealthiest ""1 percent.""
The protesters moved to Davis Park about a week ago from their previous encampment at Haddad Riverfront Park. During that time, Blackstone asked the protesters to take down their signs, as well as a blue tent structure on a Kanawha Boulevard sidewalk.
Some protesters said they moved to Davis Park to comply with the city's request not to be at Haddad.
""The people here understand that it's 'united we stand, united we fall,'"" said Charles Tyson, a Charleston protester. ""If we are taken, then America will step in.""
Tyson and Dolin said they would be arrested if police get involved. Police have been mostly supportive of Charleston's movement, Dolin said.
""Americans realize things are pretty messed up,"" he said. ""If you look at what's happening on Wall Street, every time someone is arrested, we grow in numbers.""
Nationally, some protesters have been arrested in cities like Atlanta and Oakland. In the Northern California city, violence broke out earlier this week.
Blackstone said communication with the protesters has been cordial.
""I don't think that's going to change,"" he said.
As for police involvement, ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" he said. 
Dolin said the group plans to protest in front of the state Capitol from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday.",1,Charleston,2011-10-28

Outdoor reworking of 'A Christmas Carol' makes use of actors who have been drawn into the protest movement
December 24, 2011|By Barbara Brotman, Chicago Tribune reporter


The audience members began to arrive, walking behind a man carrying a sign reading, ""Where are the jobs created by the tax cuts for the wealthy?""
Occupy Chicago was putting on a show.
The set was ready. In front of the memorial to Abraham Lincoln in Grant Park, a bench was hammered onto pieces of plywood to keep it from being blown over. Rolling wardrobes on the sides were anchored against the wind by backpacks. Scene lists were duct-taped to the tall columns on each side.
""I like that Abe Lincoln is looking over us,"" said Teresa Veramendi, looking up at the president's somber, seated figure. ""I think he would approve.""
""Occupy My Heart: A Revolutionary Christmas Carol,"" by writer-activist William Turck, is a modern take on Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"":
On a cold, snowy Christmas Eve, an ambitious Chicago banker loses his job and his money-hungry girlfriend, encounters a former love who is part of the Occupy movement, is visited by three spirits who show him painful truths, and finds redemption.
""It really stays pretty true to the classic Dickens tale of somebody who has sold out all their values to the pursuit of money and isn't really happy,"" said Zach Johnson-Dunlop, 28, who plays the banker.
The action is set amid a protest, and last week it was seen by audience members who had just come from one. The premiere — a single outdoor performance Friday afternoon — was coordinated to begin at the end of a protest march that set out from LaSalle and Jackson.
The small and chilled crowd, joined by several perplexed tourists, watched and occasionally participated, to director Hannah Friedman's delight.
The actors gently shooed away a man who had walked on stage to take close-up pictures of what he thought was a real TV newscast but was actually part of the show. And one Occupy regular kept joining the actors portraying protesters in the show.
Turck conceived of the play just before Thanksgiving. As he attended Occupy Chicago's general assemblies, he was struck by how many theater people he was meeting.
""I thought, 'Boy, if we could channel this talent, there's no better form of communication, heart to heart, than art,'"" he said.
Christmas was a little more than a month away. And Turck happened to be a great fan of Dickens.
""On DVD somewhere, I've got just about every version of 'A Christmas Carol,'"" he said.
Turck had his concept. He banged out the script in a week, returned to Occupy's general assembly ""and tried to convince people I was sane.""
""He jumped up and said, 'I have written a play,'"" said Veramendi, 26, an actress who teaches theater in Chicago schools. ""People were very excited. … Everyone cheered.


""It's a great vehicle to get people interested and to bring more people into the conversation who might not come out to a protest — but who might come to a play.""
Friedman, 22, who has been an assistant director and stage manager at Lookingglass Theatre Company, Piven Theatre Workshop and Chicago Dramatists, saw a notice on a Chicago theater website asking for actors and a director for an Occupy play. She met with Turck and Veramendi.
""I got a chance to read the script, and I really liked it a lot,"" Friedman said. ""He's taken this classic — it's almost become an icon in American culture — and turned it into a revolutionary story.""
Turck's version differs in one important respect. ""Our banker, Josh, is a likable character. He's not Scrooge,"" he said. ""His arguments are compelling.
""We tried to be very realistic. We didn't want to be cartoonish. We really wanted people to think.""
On Friday, actors changed costumes — all of which included coats — on stage, in the open. No one used mics, and though traffic hummed, sirens yowled and trains whistled, the actors generally made themselves heard.
The audience, standing behind or sitting on the steps up to the memorial, chanted along with the play's protesters and tried to stay warm. One young man passed out chemical hand warmers; another, cookies.
At the end, people wiggled upward-raised fingers, an Occupy expression of approval, and gave enthusiastic reviews.
""It was funny, but it also had real events and actions. And I liked the turnaround of the main character,"" said Ryan Griffin, who added powerful praise for an outdoor performance in winter:
""I was really getting cold, and I wanted to get out of here. But I really wanted to see the play.""
""Occupy My Heart"" will be performed indoors, for free, at 8 p.m. Monday at the Prop Theater, 3502-04 N. Elston Ave., and at 8 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday at Studio BE, 3110 N. Sheffield Ave.
A radio play the cast recorded was to be broadcast at 10 a.m. Saturday on WCPT, 820 AM, during Marshall Stern's ""Awakened America"" program. A podcast of the show was scheduled to be posted soon at bit.ly/uH3oBb.

Hundreds ""Occupy Cincinnati""
CINCINNATI, OH (FOX19) -                         
Hundreds gathered at Lytle Park Saturday morning to ""Occupy Cincinnati."" The group then marched through downtown, and wound its way to Fountain Square where it had secured a permit to meet. Speakers, music, and rallying against corporate America were all included in the day's activities.
A wide variety of signs supporting or protesting various causes could be seen, but Mardell Glinski-Schultz of Greenhills told Fox 19, ""If you walk around and look at the signs, almost everybody brought out their own agenda, but I think that there is a common denominator and I think that common denominator is greed. It's the power of the corporations. The government is no longer for the people, and every one of these issues in its own separate way relates to that.""
According to occupycincinnati.org, the group believes that 1% of the country's population has amassed 99% of the wealth. Justin Jeffre attended the protest also, ""We believe we have a duty to make this a better, more fair, equitable society. We have too much poverty. We have too much adult poverty and child poverty in this country and we're here to change that. We're here to demand change.""
Similar protests have spread from New York City to cities across the country, and beyond.  But critics of the group's message are speaking up, too.  In Washington D.C., House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said of the growing protests, ""I for one am increasingly concerned about the growing mobs occupying Wall Street and the other cities across the country.

It's estimated that about 500 people took part in the protest.  Cincinnati Police say it remained a peaceful one.

406,1767,"6 protesters form Occupy Cleveland
by DAVID DAVIS, Managing Editor

view slideshow (3 images)



The Occupy Wall Street movement spread to Cleveland Wednesday with six people marching from Johnston Park to the Bradley County Courthouse Plaza where they held signs and waved to passing motorists.
“We are everywhere and we are everyone,” said Howard Hayes, of Benton. “We are here in support of Occupy Wall Street in New York City to make the people’s voice heard. Many of us feel the people’s voice is no longer being heard.”
Hayes alleged the Occupy movement focused on Wall Street because bankers and corporations have purchased politicians and all the rights and privileges of a human being with none of the responsibilities.
Beth Foster, of Cleveland, said a decision on how visible the local protest will be depends on conclusions made by a general assembly of the participants. The assembly is designed so there is no hierarchy or leadership and everyone’s voice is heard.
The goal, she said, is to get money out of politics.
“We want to own our government again,” she said. “The American people no longer own the government.”
Foster said they might decide to occupy a space in Cleveland at some point in the future, but most of the locals are working with Occupy Chattanooga.
“We may be doing the actual occupation with them, but what we want people to know is there is a presence in Cleveland,” she said.
Foster said Occupy has been compared to the tea party movement that sprang up prior to the last presidential election. The difference is that Occupy is not a political party. It is neither left nor right, Democrat nor Republican.
“Some of the political action committees affiliated with the Democratic Party have tried to move in on Occupy. The Democrats are as much a part of the problem as the Republicans. This is a nonpartisan movement,” she said.
Hayes said they are a very loosely formed, leaderless organization protesting against corporate greed and corruption.
“We support freedom, equality, justice and liberty,” he said. “We are being oppressed. There have been police atrocities across the country and we should absolutely have the freedom to assemble as we please, when we please in public areas.”
Foster said a desired outcome has not been established.
“There is not necessarily an end that has been established yet,” she said. “We are going through a dialoguing process to get to that end.”
Hayes has been participating in Occupy Chattanooga and planned to return to Chattanooga later in the evening to stay overnight on the lawn at City Hall.
“We are not going anywhere. We have the First Amendment right to assemble and it does not limit us to any time schedule or city ordinance,” he said. “It is our constitutional right to assemble in nonviolent protest.”
Hayes believes refusal of two Nashville magistrates to uphold the arrests of 29 protesters on Oct. 29, and 26 people on Oct. 30, based on a curfew put in place on Oct. 28, sets a legal precedent.
The Cleveland protesters are part of the Occupy movement, which began in lower Manhattan as Occupy Wall Street to decry corporate influence in government and wealth inequality. It has spread to cities large and small across the country and around the world.
Breann Murray Tolley and her husband own Clover Wreath Farm where they grow organic products in Cleveland. She is concerned about corruption and food security.
“A substantial amount of the federal budget goes to large corporate farms that do not have our health or our environment (in mind). I would really like to see the money given to small, sustainable farms so we can keep food more local and more sustainable,” she said.
Chad Jones, a sophomore at Cleveland State Community College, left the Navy only to find his military education and practical experience were disregarded, “because I didn’t have a piece of paper.”
Matthew Deniston, of Cleveland, is a member of the Georgia National Guard who has deployed twice each to Iraq and Afghanistan. He is concerned about waste and fraud in the military.
According to the Occupy Wall Street website, it is “a resistance movement with people of many colors, genders and political persuasions. The one thing we all have in common is that We Are The 99 percent that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1 percent. We are using the revolutionary Arab Spring tactic to achieve our ends and encourage the use of nonviolence to maximize the safety of all participants.”
who marched around the Bradley County Courthouse Sunday afternoon protesting the “Equal Access to Public Property Act of 2012” authored by State Rep. Eric Watson, R-Cleveland representing the 22nd Legislative District. Members of the Occupy Movement say the bill makes homelessness a crime. Csapo said hundreds of thousands of working class families have been thrown out of their homes. He charged the foreclosure policies in the United States are the extraction of wealth from the working class. There is not a jump in homeless so much as there is a jump in “un-homed” people, he explained. There are more empty houses than there are homeless families, he said.

Occupy Columbia protesters hit the road
COLUMBIA (WACH)-- Occupy Columbia protesters took their rally on the road Tuesday evening, marching from the State House to Columbia City Hall.
Nearly 100 protesters came out to oppose the possible sale of Capital City Stadium on Assembly Street to a developer that works with retailers like Walmart. At this point, city leaders haven’t confirmed if a major chain store would locate in that space.
“If that’s the case, it will be very damaging to businesses in the City of Columbia,” said protester Mel Jenkins.
He and fellow protesters say the “Occupy” movement is all about fighting big business.
Midlands development leaders say the property is an attractive location for developers. They add if a big-box store like Walmart were to locate in the downtown area, it could attract even more business.
However, protesters say the opposite will happen.
“It will kill the small businesses that have been in the community for a long time,” said protester Tim Liszewski, as he marched toward Columbia City Hall.
Council members have given initial approval to that deal. Developers say it could take at least a year before the sale is finalized.
The Columbia Blowfish baseball team will be able to play at Capital City Stadium in 2012 if they choose to do so.
Some developers say locating a baseball stadium on the Bull Street property where the mental hospital was located would be an attractive location.",1,Columbia,2011-11-02

""Occupy"" protesters take to the State House grounds
COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - A protest group who says there is a problem with greed, government and Wall Street took their cause to the State House Saturday morning.
Around 150 protesters, calling themselves ""Occupy Columbia"", gathered in front of the State House at 9:00am.
""That's been the sort of beauty of this whole thing,"" said protester Travis Bland. ""This whole Occupy movement is that everybody has their grievances and they say, 'Hey here's a forum for me to let my voice to be heard.'""
The group got its roots from the ""Occupy Wall Street"" demonstrations in New York where cries for a separation of big corporations and politics began back in September.
""They need to stay over there and handle their money with their people,"" said protester Sarah Parker. ""Don't feed money to my president to try to get them to do what they want.""
Political science experts like USC professor Dr. Robert Oldendick who have been monitoring the Occupy movement say it symbolizes the frustration of Americans on many levels. But they add the argument for change may be better steered in another direction.
""Really the problem is, and what these Occupy movements seem to be looking at is that there is too much money in politics,"" said Oldendick.  ""And the solution to that is not on Wall Street --  it's in Washington.""
Some Columbia protestors agree. While calls for change ring nationwide, experts add if political change is made, it won't happen overnight.
""To get money out of politics involves campaign finance reform and as we've seen in the past couple of years it's been going in the opposite direction,"" said Dr. Oldendick.
It is not known when the protest will end, but protest organizers say they are prepared to stay overnight if they are allowed.",1,Columbia,2011-10-15
409,1959,"Occupy Dallas moves protest hub to downtown’s Pegasus Park but won’t camp there
By ROY APPLETON
Staff Writer
rappleton@dallasnews.com 
Published: 22 November 2011 11:24 PM


Days after police ended their stay near City Hall, Occupy Dallas members are moving to a more prominent base of protests — in the heart of downtown.
They don’t plan to camp, but to maintain a 24-hour presence in and near Pegasus Park, beginning Wednesday.
“The park will provide constant exposure in a high-traffic area,” protest leader Michael Prestonise wrote in a proposal approved unanimously by the group’s general assembly Monday night. The park, at the intersection of Main and Akard streets, “is the best choice for a new location to optimize the public visibility of our movement.”
Hotels, restaurants and lofts surround the park. Twenty-three Occupy Dallas demonstrators were arrested last month for blocking the entrance to a Chase bank nearby.
The influence of and prospects for the Occupy Movement here and elsewhere are unclear. For now, the local plan puts protesters at Pegasus Park between 5 a.m. to 11 p.m., when it is open to the public. And it has them walking sidewalks nearby when the park is closed overnight.
“The city of Dallas will have no grounds for our removal so long as we maintain presence in the park (during legal hours) and then continue on the sidewalk after hours,” Prestonise wrote in the proposal.
But attorney Jonathan Winocour told the group Monday night that the city might try to enforce ordinances, such as limits on noise and a prohibition against attracting a crowd on a sidewalk by “loud talking, unusual acts or exhibitions.”
Winocour also urged the group to respect the park property, to avoid damaging trees or littering. “If you are going to occupy the space, treat it as your home,” he said.
Inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement, the local protesters have delivered wide-ranging messages decrying corporate greed, the widening wealth gap and a political system they say is corrupt and unresponsive to all but the powerful.
Since the first Occupy Dallas demonstration Oct. 6, police and other city officials have said they respect and will protect the protesters’ rights to free speech and assembly as long as they don’t violate city laws.
The city gave the group a permit to camp at Pioneer Plaza and then let the protesters temporarily settle near City Hall on Oct. 17 with conditions, such as no fires, cooking, signs or toilets at the site.
Citing violations and health and safety concerns at the camp, the city rescinded the agreement last Wednesday. And early Thursday, more than 100 police officers, some in riot gear, stepped in, removing tents and arresting 18 people without resistance. The misdemeanor charge: occupying an area closed to the public between midnight and 5 a.m. The fine: $184.
The loss of the campsite shouldn’t be a setback for the group, said Dr. Lloyd Jeff Dumas, a professor of political economy, economics and public policy at the University of Texas at Dallas.
“They don’t have to be sleeping in a park to make a difference,” he said.",1,Dallas,2011-11-22

Occupy Dallas protest continues into second day, and die-hard few plan to camp out another night

LENGTH: 385 words


Oct. 07-- A few dozen protesters who marched Thursday as part of the Occupy Dallas movement aren't ready to give up just yet -- after spending the night downtown.
""I hope that our presence will open people's eyes to what is going on,"" said Barrett Carpenter, a 19-year-old student at North Lake Community College in Irving. ""We came out to stay out here.""
As many as 500 demonstrators marched through downtown Thursday carrying signs condemning corporate greed and chanting for change in the government.
Carpenter and Jesse Leatherwood, a student at Texas A&M, were among the handful who spent the night outside the JFK Memorial at Market Avenue and Main Street.
Both were considering going home tonight but plan on coming back.
""We can't get arrested,"" Carpenter said. ""I got to go to school and work.""
Raul Reyna, a detective with the Dallas County sheriff's office, said there have been no arrests so far.
""The crowd has been working with the police,"" he said. ""We have had open communication with them.""
The protesters have informed police that they will stay put for the remainder of the day and move to a new location tonight. They would need a permit to remain where they are another night.
While the majority of the crowd dispersed Thursday afternoon following the march on the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, a handful of campaigners still held posters on the street corner.
Satori Ananda, 35, of Dallas held a sign that read, ""2gether the ants will conquer the elephant.""
Ananda said she's willing to stay as long as it takes until the elephant is conquered.
""I believe we have a duty to get our voices heard,"" she said. ""The only way to let the government know is to come together and being committed to being part of that voice.""
Joshua Carmana, 24, walked around with a poster that read, ""The corrupt fear us, the honest join us.""
Though he has to leave for a job interview this afternoon, Carmana said he'd be back tonight.
""This movement to get what we want is going to take a long time,"" he said. ""When we are serious about things, the more likely we will get things done.""
The Occupy Wall Street protests began three weeks ago in New York City and have spread to more than 500 cities.

Occupy protest at Iowa Democratic Party HQ
Written by GRANT RODGERS and TOM ALEX                 
        
Eight ""Occupy"" protesters were arrested at Iowa Democratic Party headquarters in Des Moines. The protesters, whose hands were zip-tied behind their backs, were placed in a police wagon and transported to Polk County jail. Each was to be charged with criminal trespassing.
These eight people were cited Monday for trespassing at Iowa Democratic Party headquarters in Des Moines:
Edward Bloomer, 64, of Des Moines
Julie Brown, 34, of Des Moines
Frank Cordaro, 60, of Des Moines
Clarke Davidson, 28, of Des Moines
Renee Espeland, 50, of Des Moines
Anthony Hide, 25, of Baton Rouge, La.
Jessica Reznicek, 30, of Centerville
Julie Strain, 45, of Des Moines
Demonstrators say no more protests are planned at two prominent Democratic Party sites in Des Moines after eight people were arrested Monday.
But group members could change their minds at any time, representatives of Occupy Des Moines said, and tactics like those that preceded the arrests are planned for large-scale rallies starting next week at Republican presidential candidate campaign offices in central Iowa.
Occupy Des Moines, in its attempts to bring attention to the disparity between rich and poor Americans, has organized rallies at banks and other locations since October, most lasting only a few hours.
But on Saturday, after a pair of protests at President Barack Obama’s Des Moines campaign office at 621 E. Second St., some group members vowed to remain there until their demands for the president to reject certain legislation were met.
They couldn’t get inside the office, though, and about 11 a.m. Monday protesters moved to Iowa Democratic Party headquarters at 5661 Fleur Drive.
“They don’t want to be here to listen to us; we decided to go to the state headquarters and make them listen to us,” said Daniel Bragg of Occupy Des Moines.
Police told 12 protesters that they could either leave or be arrested. Eight people, whose hands were zip-tied behind their backs, were placed in a police wagon and transported to the Des Moines police station at around 2 p.m., where they were cited and released.
Each was to be charged with criminal trespassing, a misdemeanor. They did not resist arrest.
“While we recognize their right to lawful protests, an occupation of our office is not acceptable and only interferes with the work we do to elect Democrats and build a better future for Iowa and our nation,” party Executive Director Norm Sterzenbach said in a prepared statement.
Demonstrators said that despite the arrests, they were pleased with the response they received from Democratic Party employees who permitted them to share concerns and read a prepared statement about legislation that would, among many other things, trim education spending and authorize a pipeline passing through Plains states.
Karen Jenson, a New Yorker who was visiting family and wanted to see Occupy Des Moines’ activities, said she was impressed with the protesters’ organization and the respect shown by demonstrators and party employees.
“They didn’t call police right away — they listened to what we had to say,” Jenson said. “They did make it clear that they would call the police.”
There are no plans to re-occupy the campaign office or the Democrats’ headquarters, Brandon Griffis of Occupy Des Moines said later Monday, but “that doesn’t mean we might not get together and decide to do that within a day or so.”
Griffis said the activities that led up to the arrests are similar to what is expected during the “People’s Caucus” Dec. 27 and “occupations” of presidential campaign offices from Dec. 27 to Jan. 3. Local demonstrators have invited visitors to come to Iowa and take part in the rallies as the political world focuses on Iowa and its leadoff presidential nominating contest Jan. 3.
Protesters say they will keep the protests civil, but many have said they will risk arrest.
“We’re hoping that that’s not the case; we’d love to be able to sit down with the candidates and share the concerns of the 99 percent and have a discourse,” Griffis said.

“While we recognize their right to lawful protests, an occupation of our office is not acceptable and only interferes with the work we do to elect Democrats and build a better future for Iowa and our nation,” party Executive Director Norm Sterzenbach said in a prepared statement.
Demonstrators said that despite the arrests, they were pleased with the response they received from Democratic Party employees who permitted them to share concerns and read a prepared statement about legislation that would, among many other things, trim education spending and authorize a pipeline passing through Plains states.
Karen Jenson, a New Yorker who was visiting family and wanted to see Occupy Des Moines’ activities, said she was impressed with the protesters’ organization and the respect shown by demonstrators and party employees.
“They didn’t call police right away — they listened to what we had to say,” Jenson said. “They did make it clear that they would call the police.”
There are no plans to re-occupy the campaign office or the Democrats’ headquarters, Brandon Griffis of Occupy Des Moines said later Monday, but “that doesn’t mean we might not get together and decide to do that within a day or so.”
Griffis said the activities that led up to the arrests are similar to what is expected during the “People’s Caucus” Dec. 27 and “occupations” of presidential campaign offices from Dec. 27 to Jan. 3. Local demonstrators have invited visitors to come to Iowa and take part in the rallies as the political world focuses on Iowa and its leadoff presidential nominating contest Jan. 3.
Protesters say they will keep the protests civil, but many have said they will risk arrest.
“We’re hoping that that’s not the case; we’d love to be able to sit down with the candidates and share the concerns of the 99 percent and have a discourse,” Griffis said.

Covering Ron Paul                
                         
Five Occupy Des Moines members were arrested in Ankeny this morning after blocking the doors to Ron Paul’s Iowa presidential headquarters, said Drew Ivers, the congressman’s state campaign chairman.
A press release from the movement said that those gathered were protesting Paul’s anti-abortion stance, as well as his plans to make cuts to the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Ivers said the Occupiers arrived at the office, a suite located at 207 NE Delaware Ave., around 8 a.m. and were dispersed within a couple of hours.
The property’s landlord — not campaign staffers — called police to the scene, Ivers said.
“A little more than a half dozen” protesters showed up in total, he added.
“(The Ankeny Police) asked them to leave; they chose not to,” Ivers said. “I think a few were arrested and taken away. So there was no disturbance in terms of everything continued on without a hitch inside the office.”
Campaign operations were not interrupted and the Occupiers did not enter the office. The campaign routinely keeps its doors locked, even during business hours, Ivers.
“They were rather mild. They didn’t get violent by any means,” he said of the protesters. “It didn’t stop anything because we standardly keep the door closed.”
Paul addressed the issue this morning after WHO radio’s Jan Mickelson informed him during a live interview that his Iowa office was the site of a protest. Occupy Des Moines members protested at former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s Iowa headquarters Wednesday.
“I didn’t even hear that yet,” said Paul, whose has had Occupy Des Moines members attend past campaign events. “It must not have been a big enough deal yet for them to tell me.”
The congressman went on to say he thinks there are parts of his libertarian message that would resonate with those involved in the Occupy movement.
“They don’t like the bailouts and I don’t like the bailouts; so there are some things that we can agree on,” he said. “I think the tea party movement and the Occupy movement are motivated for different reasons, but they come together because they don’t trust government anymore, and that’s why I think I can connect with both groups.”
Paul has a full day of campaigning ahead of him with town hall meetings planned in Perry, Atlantic and Council Bluffs.

 HUMBOLDT OCCUPATIONS CONTINUE: Defying oncoming rain and frost, occupiers weather on after 27 days and nights. Occupy HSU has 10 student campers sleeping on the Quad. Occupy Arcata, with 10-15 demonstrators, has moved its encampment quarters from the Arcata Plaza to the Arcata City Hall lawn staying one step ahead of numerous complaints. The Arcata Eye gives us the latest chapter in true Hoover style reporting the humps and lumps taking place there.
In Occupy Eureka, 15 occupiers are holding down their narrow patch of sod with tents and a makeshift kitchen – despite the ‘No Camping’ signs drilled into the Courthouse lawn early last Thursday morning and a phalanx of 6 officers reportedly staring them down from across the street the night before. It was reported by witnesses that independent news media were denied access to the Occupy Eureka protest last week leading to the verbally abusive and hostile exchange of words by activist Kim “Verbena” Starr. Starr’s agitating actions and temper were later disapproved of as not being representative of the demonstrators and “not condoned” by the Occupy Eureka General Assembly when the censorship complaint was brought forward the following day.
Eureka Police Department officers were dispatched to US Bank this Wednesday in response to a report that protesters in dark clothes and masks were causing a disturbance by shouting and banging on the bank’s window with a big stick. Officers found the activists a few blocks away, protesting outside Bank of America and Chase. Rumors are circulating on good authority the protesters’ days are numbered: overnighters occupying the courthouse lawn will soon be evicted in short order by the long boot of EPD, perhaps by the time you read this.

FLINT -- The “Occupy Together” movement that started on Wall Street continues to sweep cities across the nation. On Friday the grass roots effort moved to Flint.
Hundreds of people descended on downtown Flint for the event that started around 12:00p.m. on the corner of Saginaw and First Streets.
The group was protesting a number of things from political corruption and corporate greed to the lack of jobs in the area.
People chanted “we want change” over and over while they carried signs with messages of disenchantment they felt with America.
 ""People are struggling to pay their bills and they keep raising our bills,"" said Flint resident Stan Downes.
""People have to make a living. They have to have houses. They have to have some security,” said Swartz Creek resident John Apperson.
The Flint protest is part of a nationwide movement called “Occupy Together.”  It started in mid-September on Wall Street and is now sweeping cities across the nation.  The purpose of the protests is a little vague. The Washington Post is calling it “a leaderless movement without an official set of demands.” Whatever the case may be, one thing is clear, these people are fed up with the country’s state of affairs.


""I see too many people that are homeless, losing their jobs or homes and it shouldn't be that way, "" said Clio resident Juanita Coleman.
""We are supposed to be the richest country, so prove it and help the poor,” said Downes.
""I think it's about time that American's stood up for their rights and make the corporate world accountable for they do especially to people lives,"" said Flushing resident Pam Bakken.
Flint is now one of more than 200 cities joining the ""Occupy Together"" movement over the last weeks.
State and U.S. leaders have referenced the protests but whether the demonstrations will make a difference remains yet to be seen.
""I think we have elected people to take care of these things and they should have some ideas and get them through. They need to work together,” said Coleman.
 ""I hope it makes a difference. I really do. What other choice do we have right now?"" said Downes.",1,Flint,2011-10-14

Protesters use downtown Frederick as platform to save the American dream
More than 40 people led by MoveOn rally to send message to politicians
by Margarita Raycheva, Staff Writer


Armed with posters, slogans and umbrellas, more than 40 protesters on Wednesday gathered at the intersection of Market and Patrick streets in downtown Frederick to urge anyone who passed by to help save the American dream.
Inspired by the American Dream Movement and protest rallies that have been going on in cities across the country, protesters urged politicians to put stop the war, end budget cuts and invest money to address the job crisis in order to save the American middle class.
And despite the rainy weather, people of all ages held up signs, sang Woody Guthrie’s “This Land is Your Land” and encouraged drivers to honk in support of their message.
“I am here to support the American Dream Movement,” said Valerie Hartman, a Frederick resident and a teacher, who has already participated in a similar rally in Washington, D.C. Hartman’s children, on the other hand, marched in the Occupy Wall Street rally in New York.
“There was no way I was going to miss the one in Frederick,” said Hartman who carried a sign stating “Capitalism with Compassion.”
“I want the war to end. I want money being spent here in America for jobs,” she said.
“I don’t want anarchy and I don’t want communism,” she added. “I want capitalism with compassion.”
The American Dream Movement endorses 10 steps to revive the American Dream. Among other steps, the movement urges politicians to stop the war, invest in American infrastructure, outlaw corporate tax breaks and invest in public education and creating 21st century energy jobs.
“I can’t imagine any American being against that,” Hartman said.
Frederick resident Art Silverman agreed and said he took his 8-year-old son Charlie out of school just so he could participate in the protest.
“I took him out of school for a lesson in democracy,” Silverman said.
“We want to let people know that the Tea Party doesn’t have a monopoly on patriotism in Frederick,” he added.
The Frederick protest was one of more than 300 events taking place around the country as part of American Dream Movement’s “Jobs Not Cuts” week of action, which started on Monday.
“We are a huge movement,” said Jeannette Bartelt, a 64-year-old Frederick resident and the Frederick MoveOn coordinator who organized the Frederick rally.
Founded in 1998, MoveOn is an American nonprofit progressive public policy advocacy group and political action committee. The group started as an email group and today allows members to promote local civil action and organize protests.
Though the rally was focused on national issues, Bartelt said she hopes it would be an opportunity to address politicians — such as U.S. Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett (R - Dist. 6) of Buckeystown to Frederick Board of County Commissioners President Blaine R. Young (R) — and confront them about cutting jobs.
Bartelt said she was very pleased with the turnout at the event on Wednesday, especially because the weather was bad and it took place in the middle of the work week.
“People are hurting,” she said. “This is really a people’s movement.”
Susan Beam, another Frederick resident who joined the protest agreed with that. Beam, who is self-employed and used to paint homes, said the bad economy has deprived her of the opportunity to take care of herself. So she said she wants to see politicians stop investing in the war and put money into job creation inside the U.S.
“I don’t want welfare, I just want a job,” she said. “I want to support myself.”

Gainesville is officially occupied.
Occupy Gainesville started its occupation of the city Wednesday at 8 a.m. at the Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
Protesters peacefully marched to Wells Fargo and Bank of America to persuade people to close their bank accounts and educate them about banking in America.
After 20 years, Coral MacDonald, 47, closed his account with Bank of America.
""In the last six months, I've been feeling my poor relationship with Bank of America,"" he said.
MacDonald said bank officials wouldn't allow him to enter the bank holding his flag, which read ""occupy or live a lie."" He gave it to another protester and walked in to close his account.
He said he has been planning on closing his bank account since he saw the increased debit card rates six months ago.
He walked out, cut his then-unusable card in front of his old bank and threw it away.
MacDonald said he has moved his money from Bank of America to a credit union and is trying to encourage his 18-year-old daughter to do the same.
Juan Diaz, 47, turned in his resignation letter to the state government four weeks ago and officially resigned Wednesday after 22 years as an engineer.
""I believe professionalism and corporatism are corrupted at every level,"" he said.
He would not say which government agency employed him.
Contractors who worked with his state government agency, he said, went against regulations, specifications and standards of the government.
The state gave $200,000 to a contractor who didn't deserve the money on a project Diaz was working on, he said.
""The shift I have seen since a year ago is about cutting the agencies and shift the money and resources to the private sector by mandate of Rick Scott,"" he said.
Diaz said he didn't want to quit initially.
""My integrity was constantly being pinched, and I couldn't stand it anymore,"" he said.
Diaz said he heard about Occupy Gainesville over the Internet.
Another protester, Eddy Arenas, 32, said he found about the Occupy Wall Street movement from videos on the Internet.
""We have a personal responsibility,"" he said. ""We can't just keep pointing fingers at the ruling elite ... we put ourselves in this position.""
Arenas said he understands the Gainesville Police Department has city ordinances to follow when the time comes, and he appreciates how cooperative the GPD has been.
""The most important thing we are getting from this is the connections we've made from so many great people who care about fixing the problems that affect this world,"" he said.
UF students are joining the occupation movement across all college campuses.
Skye Schmelzer, sophomore psychology major, organized Occupy UF along with two other students.
Schmelzer also got UF included in the Occupy Florida Colleges coalition.
""People are pissed off and they are taking a stand,"" she said.
At time of publication, Occupy Gainesville had a permit that allowed protesters to stay overnight at the plaza Wednesday night.
Occupy Gainesville's general assembly decided to fulfill the permit, said Maya Garner, a protester.
Since the general assembly fulfilled the permit, it has forfeited its ability to reapply and receive a longer permit, she said.
""The general assembly will decide tomorrow evening if they will stay Thursday night,"" Garner said. ""If they decide to stay in the park tomorrow night, it will be in civil disobedience.""
Occupy UF will have its first meeting at 5 p.m. Thursday at Turlington Plaza to organize.

Occupy Hartford protesters make their way from the campsite at Turning Point Park on Broad Street and Farmington Avenue to the Legislative Office Building and the State Capitol Thursday.
Jennifer Willett, 29, of West Hartford, a PhD student in the UConn School of Social Work, chants while marching down Broad Street Thursday. Occupy Hartford called for students to stage a 2:00 p.m. walkout and gather at their campsite on Farmington Avenue and Broad Street at 3:00 to march to the State Capitol to protest high tuition. All PhD students in the UConn School of Social Work took the afternoon to join the protest. 'I think (the teachers) would have been upset if we didn't,' said Willett. She said her teachers were a little disappointed that the students told them about the walkout. 'They said, 'Don't ask permission to start a revolution.'

HOUSTON -
Hundreds of protesters in Houston joined a national movement Thursday.
Occupy Wall Street launched a protest on big business and accused it of putting America in a financial mess. Protesters are asking supporters to close accounts in major banks and to move money into credit unions. They also want reforms to campaign finance.
Hundreds of people with Occupy Houston protested in downtown Houston beginning at Market Square Park, 301 Milam.
They marched to the J.P. Morgan Chase Tower, 600 Travis, to speak out against corporate greed, a sagging economy and high unemployment. Many carried signs.
""I can't change the laws, but I can do this,"" college student Jonay Hulin said. ""I do have the power to let my voice be heard.""
""We're the people that are bearing the brunt of the financial crisis,"" protester Kit Fordwce said.
Protesters assembled at Hermann Square in front of Houston City Hall, 901 Bagby, at 10 a.m.
""I've done OK in this downturn, but people in my family have suffered,"" protester Christopher Keeble said. ""No hope of getting jobs.""
""Occupy Houston is a local expression of the global movement to end the corporate corruption of our democracy,"" organizers said in a press statement. ""It is a volunteer-organized effort providing infrastructure and support for Houstonians to exercise their First Amendment rights.""
Protesters in Austin, Dallas, Washington D.C., Portland, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City plan to march on Thursday as well.
Several hundred marchers worked their way to the Federal Reserve Building in Dallas. Several dozen demonstrators also gathered at Austin's City Hall.
Organizers of the protests said they plan to occupy those locations for as long as possible. The main Occupy Wall Street protests began Sept. 17 and have spread across the country.
Other major cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Miami and Boston, have held protests since mid-September.

421,3072,"(Gallery and Video) Occupy Iowa City Takes Over College Green Park
More than 200 people gathered in College Green Park on Friday night in solidarity with the ""Occupy"" movement that started in New York last month.
Posted by Stephen Schmidt (Editor), October 8, 2011 at 02:16 pm


Occupy Wall Street has now officially spread to Iowa City.
Between 200 and 300 people from all over Eastern Iowa gathered in for ""Occupy Iowa City"" Friday night, expressing frustration with the state of the country, with corporate control of their lives, and with the great disparity of wealth between the richest one percent of income earners and the rest of the nation.
""The system is not working,"" said Jeanne Green, 57, of Lone Tree, as she held a sign proclaiming ""Tax the Rich"" at the edge of a nearby street, receiving supportive honks from passing motorists.
Green, who works at in Iowa City, said her two children who have graduated college are struggling to find good work in today's economy.
""That's not the American Dream, that's not why I encouraged them to go to college,"" Green said.
The crowd of people included the employed, the underemployed, and unemployed; local politicians, college students, children and the elderly. All there for different reasons, but all, apparently, with a common sense that many things in the country are broken, and need to be fixed.
The with the ongoing protest that originally started last month in New York as a critique of the financial sector's role in the meltdown of the world economy in 2008.
Some of the protestors said they intended to stay indefinitely as a show of support for the cause.
They claimed a section in the east side of the park with tables, chairs, signs and at least 15 tents to mark their territory. Earlier in the day, the police changed their tune by saying they would not attempt to push protestors out of the park when it closed at 11 p.m.
Still, the group will have to solve some basic needs, such as bathrooms, cooking, warmth and safety, if they are to succeed with a lengthy occupation. People had been stopping by throughout the evening with bags of groceries, baked goods and other supplies, said Shay O'Reilly, a recent UI graduate.
""As long as it takes,"" Hannah Staley, 19, a University of Iowa sophomore, said of how long she plans to stay. ""I personally am here because I am tired of how things are, and it will be worth the effort of figuring out what it takes to stay out here.""
Boyfriend and girlfriend, Ricardo Mantilla and Misty Rebik, of Iowa City, were one pair who said they planned on staying on together as long as it takes to get congress and the president to respond to the movement's message.
""End the tax breaks for the corporations and use that money to rebuild our infrastructure,"" said Mantilla.
Rebik agreed, iPhone in hand, sitting next to the red tent where she was planning on spending the night.
""We don't have a debt problem in this country, we have a revenue problem,"" she said. ""I don't necessarily have a problem with a fair, equivalent tax rate for everyone, but the fact is that things aren't fair right now.""
Late night, the crowd was subdued.
By midnight, around 50 people were settled in for the night. Some had gone to sleep, and others huddled around the park's gazebo, occassionally fielding questions from intoxicated students walking through.
""The way the economy has been handled, the way the bailouts have been handled,"" Jared Krauss, 21, a University of Iowa junior answered two people who identified themselves as college students as to why he is protesting. ""We are paying for tuition for college, and there are supposed to be jobs there for us, and they're not there.""
The protest itself was civil, at least the early goings. The movement is leaderless, and decisions about the occupation were made through majority decisions at a general assembly at the center of the park, with the crowd amplifying each speaker's suggestion by repeating what they just said, with each decision receiving approval or disapproval through a smattering of hand signals.
And the decisions, for a movement that has been portrayed by some national media outlets as either ineffectual or dangerous, were exeedingly polite. Alcohol and drugs were prohibited by group fiat ; the protest mission statement was left intentionally vague to welcome people of varying political beliefs; the city and the police were recognized for allowing the protest to peacebly occur ; and groups were established to provide food to those who stayed and clean up after they have gone, down to the last cigarette butt.
Clarence Johnson, a database administrator from Iowa City who attended the event, said it might appear from the outside like the movement has no clear goals, but that this is in fact intentional. He said that since the movement already brought together hundreds of people to talk about the nation's problems already fulfills a part of its purpose.
""If they had a list of demands, or a leadership structure, this would allow people to automatically prescreen themselves out because of the one part of it they don't agree with,"" Johnson said. ""Regardless of where you stand on the political spectrum, we can all agree that there are real issues that need to be dealt with.""",1,Iowa City,2011-10-08

LONG BEACH - As police in Oakland cleared a camp of Occupy protesters Tuesday, participants in Long Beach's offshoot of the anti-Wall Street movement operated in a detente with law enforcement at Lincoln Park.
Speaking against what they called the ""tyranny"" of large banks and corporations, Occupy Long Beach has settled into a pattern of small, lounging protests by day, gathering after business hours in larger numbers and, for the die-hard adherents to the group, striking their tents and moving to the sidewalk after 10 p.m.
The ongoing schedule agreement was reached through consultation between police and leaders of the now 11-day-old occupation of the park next to City Hall at 333 W. Ocean Blvd.
Long Beach Deputy Police Chief Robert Luna said the policy itself was created after study of the city's ordinance that bars camping in parks and public spaces.
He defined the ensuing rules as firm but respectful in regard to what protesters can and cannot do.
""Our goal is to allow them to exercise their First Amendment rights without being in violation of the city ordinance,"" Luna said.
Though protesters can slumber at night, there's no real sleep for the weary at Lincoln Park in the eyes of the law.
""They can rest for a while, but they have to wake up and walk around periodically,"" Luna said.
Protesters this week credited police for working with them, but complained about the floodlights that have been used at night to illuminate the park.
Among their demands of government was a call for restoring regulations governing corporations that have been cut over the last few decades.
""A corporation is unaccountable to people,"" said Jonathan Allen, 26, of Seal Beach.
Small businesses and banks can't compete against conglomerates such as Wal-Mart and Bank of America in the present era of deregulation, he argued.
""The analogy is a pro-football player geared up, ready to tackle an elementary school football player,"" Allen said.
A 27-year-old woman who identified herself as Sunrise pointed to vacant office space around Lincoln Park and said she shows up out of a desire to rebuild the community.
""I believe you can't change the world unless you change the community you live in first,"" she said.
Besides attracting attention to its cause, Occupy Long Beach, like other chapters nationwide, has also attracted part of downtown's homeless population.
""They're flocking to us for the free food,"" said Allen.
Some homeless participate in the protests or hold signs, while others squabble with protesters for what they view as their ""territory,"" according to Allen.
""They need to realize they're part of the 99 percent,"" Allen said, adding that organizers are considering a move to another city park.
Criminal incidents at Lincoln Park have been sporadic, officials said.
The few protesters who have been arrested for camping in the park after 10 p.m. were given verbal warnings and blatantly violated the regulations agreed upon by officers and Occupy Long Beach representatives, police said.
Sunday night, after police experimented with turning off the floodlights at night, two protesters were arrested for domestic violence, and a homeless couple fought over a cellphone and were arrested for allegedly making terrorist threats, Luna said.
Luna was grateful for the relative peace in Long Beach, considering other cities have experienced less cooperative, more civilly disobedient protesters.
""We've had some problems with a few individuals getting into officers' faces and trying to force confrontations, but the vast majority have been respectful and so have the officers,"" Luna said.

Protesters march across 4th Street in downtown Long Beach as part of the Occupy Long Beach movement rallies that happened on Oct. 15 and Oct. 16.

Long Beach residents and community organizers took to the streets and gathered at Lincoln Park in the city’s downtown district last weekend to protest in solidarity with the Occupy Together movement. The Occupy Long Beach events culminated on Sunday with two arrests and two other citations after a number of participants came to disagreements with the police officers who attempted to usher them out of the public park.
The purpose of the non-violent, non-partisan movement, which continues to spread across the country, is to protest corporate greed. Following the Declaration of the Occupation of New York City document and intending to help represent the disadvantaged “99 percent” majority that is suffering from an unfair global economy, the hundreds of sign-wielding protestors chanted and expressed their concerns over the “one percent” of corporate America that they believe have come to run the government.
In light of the New York City General Assembly occupying Wall Street in Liberty Square, more than 250 students, community advocates and educators occupied and rallied in the city’s financial district Saturday morning. The crowd then marched to Lincoln Park for the general assembly that continued well into Sunday, as people began setting up temporary shelters at night.
In a press release sent to the Signal Tribune by event coordinators, local organizer Tammara Phillips echoed the event’s purpose and said, “We are a grassroots, local movement in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street…we are the 99 percent.” Cal State Long Beach student and organizer Ben Fisher attended the protests and said he had worked closely with the City beforehand to ensure that participation in the movement was as transparent as possible.
Still, Fisher said that he and the other organizers never received the proper cooperation and partnership from the City, and in an email sent to several news outlets on Oct. 17, he described many instances throughout the evening when police officials would harass protesters over the manner in which they could occupy the park.
“Before sundown, the City set up three sets of floodlights running on loud portable generators,” Fisher wrote in the email. “Between the brightness of the lights, the droning of the generators, and constant harassment by the LBPD, Occupy Long Beach was up all night.”
In a press release recapping Saturday’s events, the Long Beach Police Department (LBPD) characterized the demonstration as a display of mutual respect between police and the demonstrating community with demonstrators able to express their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech while obeying all applicable laws.
The LBPD issued another press release on Oct. 17 to illustrate the outcome of Sunday’s demonstration. Police officials said that as the night neared 10pm, the hour in which the park closed, the group grew to approximately 75 in attendance and were warned to disperse. Most subjects proceeded to exit the park and move onto the sidewalk, however police officials made the decision to arrest 30-year-old Jason James and a minor for failing to comply with the request to vacate the park.
According to the press release, the group chanted and yelled in defiance of police while they searched other tents in the park. Lakewood resident Louis Rodriguez and Seal Beach resident Jonathan Allen were issued citations and released at the scene.
Colleges also partook in the Occupy Together movement, including Long Beach City College (LBCC), which coordinated Occupy LBCC on Monday evening and established a similar encampment at the Liberal Arts Campus lawn. The Occupy Los Angeles event took place the evening of Oct. 19 when occupiers marched from Olvera Street.
At the Oct. 19 Long Beach City Council meeting, five supporters of the Occupy Long Beach movement spoke or stated the reasons for being involved in the movement during the public-comment portion. Voicing their support of the movement, 1st District Councilmember Robert Garcia addressed the noise and pollution of the lighting generators, and 8th District Councilmember Rae Gabelich suggested that some modification of the non-camping statutes be considered, according to Phillips’s email and confirmed Thursday by Gabelich.

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Los Angeles police used nearly a dozen undercover detectives to infiltrate the Occupy L.A. encampment in the weeks before their raid. 
According to City News Service, the officers blended in to learn about protestors' intentions and to see whether they planned to resist or use weapons against police.
Nearly 300 people were arrested during Wednesday's predawn raid at City Hall Park.
Police are downplaying the significance of the undercover work, saying Occupy meetings were public and information was easy to get.
Meanwhile, Occupy L.A. protesters once again took to the streets on Saturday, with one person reportedly being arrested by police.
The person was reportedly arrested at the Bank of America branch at 6th and Hill streets in downtown Los Angeles.
Demonstrators had gathered there, with some allegedly banging on the locked doors.
As many as 200 people walked from Pershing Square to City Hall. For the most part, the demonstration was peaceful.

431,3638,"Occupy L.A. protesters return to downtown streets
December 3, 2011 | 10:01 pm


Occupy Los Angeles protesters returned to the streets Saturday in a large march that included many of the same demonstrators who were arrested during a police sweep of their camp outside City Hall last week.
At least one person was arrested during Saturday’s heavily policed march in downtown L.A., apparently for failing to follow police orders to stay on the sidewalk. Other protesters identified him as Anthony Lascano.
Lascano was one of nearly 300 demonstrators who were arrested in early Wednesday’s eviction, an elaborate police action that involved some 1,400 officers.
To protest Lascano's second arrest, which demonstrators said was unnecessary, the crowd marched past the headquarters of the Los Angeles Police Department and to the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, where many Occupy arrestees had been detained. A line of police officers in riot gear blocked the doors.
Police Department spokesman Cleon Joseph confirmed that there had been an arrest at the protest but said he did not have more details.
Demonstrators complained that Lascano was ""tackled"" by police. A video posted by one marcher shows only part of the arrest.
About 100 Los Angeles police officers and private security guards trailed the protesters as they marched Saturday, according to news reports. Police have maintained a large presence at Occupy protests downtown in the days since the eviction, especially during demonstrators’ nightly general assembly meetings on the west steps of City Hall.
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who ordered the encampment closed because of health and safety concerns and because of damage to the lawn, instructed city crews to keep the west steps open while the lawn is rehabilitated so that the protesters — and anyone else — have a place to gather.",1,LosAngeles,2011-12-03

An Occupy L.A. participant dreams of changing the world

Photo gallery: Occupy Los Angeles day of action


Since late September I've been hanging around the tent city now surrounding L.A. City Hall that is Occupy Los Angeles, in various modes of commitment and involvement.
Early on I was outraged both by my growing inability to cope financially despite working full-time and galvanized by images coming from Occupy Wall Street. After decades of passivity, finally it seemed a serious organic social justice movement was evolving in the United States.
To me it seems many participants early on were middle class whites propelled by a level of economic injustice and hardship that was new to them. A Wall Street boom and crash a la 1929 and alarming numbers of home foreclosures, unemployment, growing poverty levels and waves of people about to run out of unemployment insurance have led some to compare the Occupy movement to the tent cities of the Great Depression.
While the plight of the middle class may have garnered the now-omnipresent media attention, minorities and the poor who have historically borne the brunt of economic injustice have gotten on board the Occupy train in hopes of finally equalizing the badly unbalanced status quo. There is now a crowd of roughly 500 very diverse people from all walks of life living at the L.A. encampment. The lawn is full to capacity. You can't take a step without trouncing someone's personal affects or tent tarp.
Occupy L.A. is now figuratively the last man standing, as far as Occupy encampments. While authorities around the country have swept Occupiers out systematically, the city of L.A. has taken a largely hands-off approach.
That is, until last Thursday.
That's when the LAPD, decked out in full SWAT regalia, descended en masse on Occupy L.A. marchers joined by union members as they made their way up Broadway north of Fourth Street at about noon, across from Grand Central Market downtown. Police quickly closed Broadway, fencing off the street and sidewalk, ensuring that pedestrians wouldn't be able to see as they made what one witness later called a violent arrest.
I'd been around Occupy L.A. for weeks and it was a surreal moment. For weeks I'd been seeing video footage of protesters in other cities get tear gassed, shot with rubber bullets and generally beat down by the police. But in L.A. the stand-offish stance taken by the police seems to have lulled people into a false sense of security.
So it was a shock to see the LAPD march in parade-style, with squad cars stacked as far as the eye could see down Fourth Street, even though it really shouldn't have been based on what's been happening nationwide.
""What have they done wrong?"" one onlooker asked an older police officer who was manning the LAPD's fence as fellow cops laid waste to the march. ""Don't you think it's weird that those people are getting arrested?""
The officer smiled and responded wryly, ""Ask me when I'm retired.""
Later that afternoon I found myself at the Bank of America plaza downtown, pressed from a crowd behind me pretty much right up into the personal space of an unhappy LAPD officer in full riot gear, who kept telling me to move back as the people behind me were pushing me forward. I was watching my friends get handcuffed and an officer with a rubber bullet gun pace on a planter ledge in front of me. The cops outnumbered us by some ridiculous proportion. Someone told me because of city budget cuts, they weren't being paid overtime. Another person warned us that they were loading up the tear gas. The dispersal order was given. One line of cops said we had 5 minutes to leave. On the other side of the plaza they said we had 15.
Some protesters cut through the palpable tension in the air with humor. A group sang the ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" theme song. A petite young woman apparently liked the looks of one officer and asked loudly if he was married. Others were more pointed in their humor.
""Oh good, they're here to evict Bank of America because of all the money they stole from us and all the houses they illegally foreclosed,"" protester Richard Florence said sarcastically as LAPD officers swarmed in on all sides.
But the skyscraping BofA building was safe. It wasn't the bank that the cops were there for.
My Occupy L.A. friends were pitching tents to ""occupy"" the Bank of America plaza. It was a gesture to confront the mega-bank responsible for millions of home foreclosures throughout the country with raw humanity. The juxtaposition of the newly-formed Occupy L.A. tent city at the foot of the behemoth Bank of America tower was somehow heart wrenching. It was like seeing David challenging Goliath and thinking David couldn't possibly have a chance. Before long their little tents were picked up and thrown aside by armored police as demonstrators were carried off in handcuffs. Somehow it all seemed the perfect analogy for what Bank of America and other institutions have been doing to homeowners by the millions in this country since the beginning of the foreclosure crisis.
And I didn't know there were so many cops in L.A. I guess if I ever want the LAPD's help I'll bring a tent to Bank of America, because that is clearly the way to get them out in force.
In all, 72 Occupy L.A. activists were arrested Thursday, including two young men who simply crossed a police line at an early-morning union march. It reminded me of a caption I'd seen on a photo of NYPD officers manhandling a woman at Occupy Wall Street.
""If only they enforced bank regulations like they do park rules, we wouldn't be in this mess.""
Indeed.
While Occupy L.A. has seen less than its fair share of police enforcement, I have a suspicion it's coming soon. While the L.A. City Council rolled out the red carpet early on, even distributing ponchos at one point, they now seem to be itching to get the tents and all the messy chaos that comes along with an indefinite encampment off their stoop. They've even gone as far as apparently negotiating an ""exit strategy"" with a small group of occupiers they've maintained clandestine contact with.
But protests don't work like that. And in the tradition of the Occupy movement, we'll peacefully hold our ground at City Hall as long as physically possible, and come back stronger, bigger and better after the inevitable police raid goes down.
And even if they raid us and kick us out, we're already building a response. In response to a wave of attacks on Occupy sites and a lack of response to the needs of working people nationwide, plans are underway by Occupy L.A.'s newly-formed General Strike Committee to coordinate with Los Angeles and Long Beach port workers, Occupy Oakland and Occupy Long Beach to shut down all West Coast ports on Dec. 12. This will be followed by a build-up to a widespread general strike on May 1.
But until Thursday, Occupy L.A. hadn't had a lot of police contact. It's probably because, as others have noted, Occupy L.A. hasn't had a lot of action. Many of the protesters within the encampment and those participating outside it have noticed too and are frustrated. While protesters in New York were shutting down the Brooklyn Bridge, those in Oakland were shutting down a port, and those at UC Davis were forcing campus police and a chancellor to walk off in shame, Occupy L.A.'s weekend events have largely consisted of music festivals, lectures and most recently, a health fair. Not that these are bad things. They're good. But people are waiting for strategic action. And it's coming.
I'm not saying I want to get a police baton over the head or have my skull fractured by a flash bang grenade like Iraq war veteran and protester Scott Olsen did when police raided the Oakland encampment last month. But I didn't get involved to hang out at L.A. City Hall and listen to music. As the Beatles said, ""we all want to change the world."" Well we do. And right now the world seems to need some changing.
This may be because the initial tone at Occupy L.A., or OLA, as it's now being called, was set by people who at the early planning stages wanted to cooperate with the city so much that they got permission from the Police Department to set up their encampment. These same people also have functioned as ""city liaisons,"" reporting to and meeting with city officials and police without letting the rest of us know what's going on in those meetings. I'm pretty certain this type of activity would be shunned by other Occupy movement sites.
Despite the frustrations, I see potential and haven't been able to walk away, like some have unfortunately done. There are wonderful, intelligent people who want to create a better world, and who seem to be waiting for the chance. And what better place than Los Angeles, California, maybe one of the most diverse metropolitan areas in the world? Now that the NYPD has raided and swept the encampment at Zucotti Park in New York City and many other locations, my understanding is that Occupy L.A. is the biggest and most tenable Occupy site remaining. So maybe my frustration will pay off in that Occupy L.A. has been left standing long enough to act as a beacon to Occupiers all over the country who have been displaced and want to enjoy a warm winter a la Los Angeles. I have heard they're already on their way from New York and Boston, and I've seen lots of people at Occupy L.A. from Oakland, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, Long Beach and Pasadena joining in.
And while people may have their differences, 500 or so from the homeless to the Ivy League-educated, are camping at City Hall. There is no predominant race or class representation that I can see. It's a pretty well-blended mix of people who all share a common concern: The economic system is broken and doesn't work for most people, they want a better one and the U.S. political system isn't offering any realistic solution s.
On Sunday, L.A.-based band Aztlan Underground played and indigenous dancers performed in traditional costume on the south lawn of City Hall. The band's lead singer said Occupy L.A. was an autonomous community, much like the ones that governed indigenous people that lived on that very spot before they were wiped out by colonization. With the ghostly Native American-themed music accompanying feathered headdresses swishing and the smell of incense heavy in the air, all in the shadow of LAPD Headquarters towering in the background, it could have been a disjointed dream. But there was little doubt in my mind that Occupy L.A. and its sister sites all over the country and world are indeed autonomous from the system that replaced the Gabrielino Indians that used to live where we're pitching our tents now.

But in L.A. the stand-offish stance taken by the police seems to have lulled people into a false sense of security.
So it was a shock to see the LAPD march in parade-style, with squad cars stacked as far as the eye could see down Fourth Street, even though it really shouldn't have been based on what's been happening nationwide.
""What have they done wrong?"" one onlooker asked an older police officer who was manning the LAPD's fence as fellow cops laid waste to the march. ""Don't you think it's weird that those people are getting arrested?""
The officer smiled and responded wryly, ""Ask me when I'm retired.""
Later that afternoon I found myself at the Bank of America plaza downtown, pressed from a crowd behind me pretty much right up into the personal space of an unhappy LAPD officer in full riot gear, who kept telling me to move back as the people behind me were pushing me forward. I was watching my friends get handcuffed and an officer with a rubber bullet gun pace on a planter ledge in front of me. The cops outnumbered us by some ridiculous proportion. Someone told me because of city budget cuts, they weren't being paid overtime. Another person warned us that they were loading up the tear gas. The dispersal order was given. One line of cops said we had 5 minutes to leave. On the other side of the plaza they said we had 15.
Some protesters cut through the palpable tension in the air with humor. A group sang the ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" theme song. A petite young woman apparently liked the looks of one officer and asked loudly if he was married. Others were more pointed in their humor.
""Oh good, they're here to evict Bank of America because of all the money they stole from us and all the houses they illegally foreclosed,"" protester Richard Florence said sarcastically as LAPD officers swarmed in on all sides.
But the skyscraping BofA building was safe. It wasn't the bank that the cops were there for.
My Occupy L.A. friends were pitching tents to ""occupy"" the Bank of America plaza. It was a gesture to confront the mega-bank responsible for millions of home foreclosures throughout the country with raw humanity. The juxtaposition of the newly-formed Occupy L.A. tent city at the foot of the behemoth Bank of America tower was somehow heart wrenching. It was like seeing David challenging Goliath and thinking David couldn't possibly have a chance. Before long their little tents were picked up and thrown aside by armored police as demonstrators were carried off in handcuffs. Somehow it all seemed the perfect analogy for what Bank of America and other institutions have been doing to homeowners by the millions in this country since the beginning of the foreclosure crisis.
And I didn't know there were so many cops in L.A. I guess if I ever want the LAPD's help I'll bring a tent to Bank of America, because that is clearly the way to get them out in force.
In all, 72 Occupy L.A. activists were arrested Thursday, including two young men who simply crossed a police line at an early-morning union march. It reminded me of a caption I'd seen on a photo of NYPD officers manhandling a woman at Occupy Wall Street.
""If only they enforced bank regulations like they do park rules, we wouldn't be in this mess.""
Indeed.
While Occupy L.A. has seen less than its fair share of police enforcement, I have a suspicion it's coming soon. While the L.A. City Council rolled out the red carpet early on, even distributing ponchos at one point, they now seem to be itching to get the tents and all the messy chaos that comes along with an indefinite encampment off their stoop. They've even gone as far as apparently negotiating an ""exit strategy"" with a small group of occupiers they've maintained clandestine contact with.
But protests don't work like that. And in the tradition of the Occupy movement, we'll peacefully hold our ground at City Hall as long as physically possible, and come back stronger, bigger and better after the inevitable police raid goes down.
And even if they raid us and kick us out, we're already building a response. In response to a wave of attacks on Occupy sites and a lack of response to the needs of working people nationwide, plans are underway by Occupy L.A.'s newly-formed General Strike Committee to coordinate with Los Angeles and Long Beach port workers, Occupy Oakland and Occupy Long Beach to shut down all West Coast ports on Dec. 12. This will be followed by a build-up to a widespread general strike on May 1.
But until Thursday, Occupy L.A. hadn't had a lot of police contact. It's probably because, as others have noted, Occupy L.A. hasn't had a lot of action. Many of the protesters within the encampment and those participating outside it have noticed too and are frustrated. While protesters in New York were shutting down the Brooklyn Bridge, those in Oakland were shutting down a port, and those at UC Davis were forcing campus police and a chancellor to walk off in shame, Occupy L.A.'s weekend events have largely consisted of music festivals, lectures and most recently, a health fair. Not that these are bad things. They're good. But people are waiting for strategic action. And it's coming.
I'm not saying I want to get a police baton over the head or have my skull fractured by a flash bang grenade like Iraq war veteran and protester Scott Olsen did when police raided the Oakland encampment last month. But I didn't get involved to hang out at L.A. City Hall and listen to music. As the Beatles said, ""we all want to change the world."" Well we do. And right now the world seems to need some changing.
This may be because the initial tone at Occupy L.A., or OLA, as it's now being called, was set by people who at the early planning stages wanted to cooperate with the city so much that they got permission from the Police Department to set up their encampment. These same people also have functioned as ""city liaisons,"" reporting to and meeting with city officials and police without letting the rest of us know what's going on in those meetings. I'm pretty certain this type of activity would be shunned by other Occupy movement sites.
Despite the frustrations, I see potential and haven't been able to walk away, like some have unfortunately done. There are wonderful, intelligent people who want to create a better world, and who seem to be waiting for the chance. And what better place than Los Angeles, California, maybe one of the most diverse metropolitan areas in the world? Now that the NYPD has raided and swept the encampment at Zucotti Park in New York City and many other locations, my understanding is that Occupy L.A. is the biggest and most tenable Occupy site remaining. So maybe my frustration will pay off in that Occupy L.A. has been left standing long enough to act as a beacon to Occupiers all over the country who have been displaced and want to enjoy a warm winter a la Los Angeles. I have heard they're already on their way from New York and Boston, and I've seen lots of people at Occupy L.A. from Oakland, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, Long Beach and Pasadena joining in.
And while people may have their differences, 500 or so from the homeless to the Ivy League-educated, are camping at City Hall. There is no predominant race or class representation that I can see. It's a pretty well-blended mix of people who all share a common concern: The economic system is broken and doesn't work for most people, they want a better one and the U.S. political system isn't offering any realistic solution s.
On Sunday, L.A.-based band Aztlan Underground played and indigenous dancers performed in traditional costume on the south lawn of City Hall. The band's lead singer said Occupy L.A. was an autonomous community, much like the ones that governed indigenous people that lived on that very spot before they were wiped out by colonization. With the ghostly Native American-themed music accompanying feathered headdresses swishing and the smell of incense heavy in the air, all in the shadow of LAPD Headquarters towering in the background, it could have been a disjointed dream. But there was little doubt in my mind that Occupy L.A. and its sister sites all over the country and world are indeed autonomous from the system that replaced the Gabrielino Indians that used to live where we're pitching our tents now.

Port of Oakland girds for blockade
BYLINE: By Cecily Burt Oakland Tribune
SECTION: BREAKING; My Town; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; News; Local
LENGTH: 711 words


The Port of Oakland is girding for another blockade on Dec. 12, six weeks after a Nov. 2 general strike coordinated by Occupy Oakland shut down the port overnight.
This time, however, the planned Dec. 12 economic action is expected to affect all West Coast ports as Occupy movements in Los Angeles, San Diego, Oakland, Portland, Seattle and Tacoma have so far voted to join the demonstration.
The International Longshore and Warehouse Union is not sanctioning the strike, but history has shown that will not stop individual members from supporting the blockade by refusing to work. Occupy organizers hope that union members will not cross picket lines.
Between 7,000 and 10,000 people marched on the Port of Oakland the afternoon of Nov. 2, clogging the entrances and roadways. Although shipping terminals closed down early, some truckers were blocked by the sea of people as they tried to drive out.
The action extended into the evening and effectively shut down the port for the last two shifts of the day when dockworkers either couldn't get to work or stayed away to support the strike.
The Nov. 2 strike, coupled with a work stoppage by longshoremen at the SSA and Trapac terminals due to safety concerns over refrigerated shipping containers, created a backlog of cargo that took days to resolve.
""The union is not supporting it, is not coordinating the action with Occupy Oakland,"" said Richard Mead, president of ILWU, Local 10. ""We think that working people aren't getting a fair share and we support the principal of Occupy Wall Street, but we don't support shutting down our own jobs.""
Isaac Kos-Read, director of external affairs at the Port of Oakland, said the port is working with all its partners -- business, government and law enforcement -- to prevent any disruption in the flow of goods to and from the port.
""Disrupting operations will only hurt working people, here and throughout the state and country,"" Kos-Read said.
""This is an important time of year for us, a big time of year for exports. We are the export gateway for Northern California ... and this year is a bumper crop for almonds.""
Kos-Read said that the frequent shut downs are a concern for companies that already do business with the port as well as those companies the port is trying to woo. Aside from the short-term impacts, the blockades and strikes could have lasting economic impacts for employers and workers throughout the region if companies choose other ports to move their goods, Kos-Read said.
""We want people to understand the impact on working people and our ability to create jobs,"" he said. ""The port is where the 99 percent work.""
Barucha Peller, a member of the Occupy Oakland blockade assembly, called that a ""right-wing analysis.
""Everyone from rank-and-file longshoremen to the port truckers realize we all have to make a sacrifice,"" she said. ""When we withdraw our labor, we make a (dent) in the 1 percent. Economic boycotts are very effective. The occupation movement is moving into a larger and more coherent strategy of how to disrupt the profits of the 1 percent.""
The Dec. 12 action was hatched at Occupy Los Angeles when it voted to shut down SSA terminals at the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach in solidarity with truckers who were fired when they tried to unionize, Peller said.
The blockade quickly spread up and down the West Coast. Peller said Occupy Oakland joined the blockade in solidarity with Los Angeles and with ILWU members in Longview, Wash., who are battling against a plan to use nonunion labor at a new grain facility owned by EGT. She also said the West Coast blockade was in response to the coordinated attacks against Occupy camps around the country.
The blockade will begin with a 3 p.m. rally at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, followed by a 4 p.m. march to the Port of Oakland, Peller said. A separate group will gather at the West Oakland BART station at 5 p.m. before marching on the port, she said.
Peller said the movement expects thousands of people to participate in the action, including many who hoped to replicate their experience on Nov. 2. She warned that any disruption or use of violence by law enforcement in any of the cities would be cause to extend the blockades.Inside

LOS ANGELES -- The city Department of General Services barricaded a fountain and a memorial sculpture in front of City Hall to protect them from damage by people camped on the lawn for Occupy L.A., which turns one month old today.
The Frank Putnam Flint Fountain was built in 1933 in honor of the senator's efforts to bring water to Los Angeles. A firefighters' memorial on the southwest corner of the City Hall lawn was built in 1944 to honor fire personnel killed in the line of duty.
The structures had sustained some non-permanent graffiti, mayoral spokesman Peter Sanders said. At least one protester had been spotted periodically sitting on top of the fountain, and protesters had also hung a movie screen from the fountain to project videos.
Construction of a nearly 20-foot-high wooden structure began about 4 this morning, demonstrators said, and took about six hours to complete.
City officials told the campers they were free to use the structure as a canvas for art work, said Keaton Yale, who joined Occupy L.A. a few days ago, and a number of people immediately started spray-painting it with graffiti-style writings and graphics.
Someone sprayed a large, colorful ""Power to the People"" on the west side of the structure surrounding the fountain.
Yale described the markings as less than attractive.
""It's all art, but it's not necessarily pleasing art,"" Yale said, adding that he hoped attendees at the movement's general assembly meeting tonight would take up the issue of selecting an artist to paint something ""beautiful"" on the structure. He said he was concerned the graffiti would upset people driving around City Hall and discredit the Occupy movement.
""There's a lot of good here, but there's some people here that don't know why they're here,"" Yale said. ""If stuff gets too crazy, I'm probably going to find a better organized thing.""
Occupy L.A. began Oct. 1 when protesters set up about 40 tents  on the north side of City Hall in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street. The demonstrations, which have spread nationwide, have sought to highlight what protesters call a widening gap between rich and poor.
Occupy L.A. has since grown about tenfold. Los Angeles police this morning counted about 475 tents on the 1.7-acre city park surrounding City Hall.
The much-smaller Occupy San Fernando Valley movement, which began on Saturday, continues in the courtyard of Van Nuys Civic Center. But unlike the downtown version, the Valley protesters are forbidden to camp overnight at the site.
About 8-10 people show up daily at the Van Nuys Civic Center, said LAPD Captain Tia Morris. The group leaves by 7 p.m. ""Then they go to Van Nuys Boulevard and wave their signs and march,"" said Morris.",1,LosAngeles,2011-11-01

""Occupy LA provides the stage to bring together the various sectors of society that has serious issues to deal with.""

The SEIU and United Long Term Care Workers joined Occupy LA in echoing the need to do away with corporate greed.
Day after day, out-of-work twenty-somethings, spiritual leaders and people facing foreclosure march through the streets of downtown Los Angeles protesting what they say is corporate greed.
The Service Employees International Union and United Long Term Care Workers, California's largest union, joined the march Wednesday -- echoing Occupy LA's demands and the need to pass the American Jobs Act.
""We saw unfortunately the Senate vote the whole thing down,"" said Wyatt Closs, SEIU-ULTCW. ""But there are many pieces that could get acted on right now that would make a real difference within a very short period of time and get the economy going again.""
For Juan Jose Gutierrez of the Full Rights for Immigration Coalition, there is solidarity with an added touch.
""As the movement begins to articulate the actual specific demands that we are going to be working towards resolving, one of the ones we think needs to be on that eventual list is comprehensive immigration reform,"" said Gutierrez.
If the focus is immigration, then what happens to the common cries of 99 percent and job creation? Gutierrez sees the unification of different voices as a positive for all involved.
""Occupy LA provides the stage to bring together the various sectors of society that has serious issues to deal with,"" said Gutierrez. ""I think it also provides an opportunity for all of us to realize in the end we are all in this together.""
There may be no solid end in sight, but Occupy LA protestors say the growing movement is proof that people are tired of talk and yearning for change.",1,LosAngeles,2011-10-19

Protestors of the group plan to camp out all week

|  Sunday, Oct 16, 2011  |  Updated 5:49 PM EDT


Occupy Miami protesters set up about 20 tents in the downtown area, and on Sunday they said that they plan to stay there throughout the week.
Members of the group said they set up in front of the Government Center at 111 NW 1st St. because it's near a large transportation hub and generates a lot of foot traffic. Police said that the protestors are unofficially allowed to stay at that location.
""I slept there last night with, I counted, about 100 fellow occupiers,"" said Occupy Miami member Misael Soto.
""To me, literally occupying is the greatest display of solidarity for the cause I can show ,"" Soto said as to why he camped out Saturday night. "" It's what the movement is all about. Protesting 24/7, taking back our government and economy.""
Other members of Occupy Miami expressed their concerns, and explained why they plan to keep protesting.
""I'm upset about money and politics, it's a big one,"" said group member Seth Crouser. ""I'm  personally upset about the financial collapse and how that happened and how there's been no culpability.""
""What we're doing right now is kind of an experience with democracy,"" Occupy Miami member Mike Park said. ""And it's giving us an idea of what can be done with masses.""
The group had gathered on Saturday, as hundreds of protestors gathered along Biscayne Boulevard, chanting and holding up signs showing their frustration and anger at corporate America, the federal government and the banking system.
They marched several blocks to Government Center where they continued their demonstration. Drivers honked to show their support as protestors stood outside.
People chanted and held up signs. One sign read: ""Banks Were Bailed Out You Were Sold Out"" and another read ""Healthcare Not Warfare."" Meanwhile, the Herald reported that police said the number of protestors had been more than 1,000.
People continued discussing the protest on Occupy Miami's Facebook page throughout the weekend. Protestors also gathered in Fort Lauderdale on Sunday in the Bubier park area to show their continued support of the Occupy movement.
""Hey everyone!"" Occupy Fort Lauderdale posted on their Facebook page. ""It's a beautiful day to make our presence known in FTL! Come on down to the Bubier park area and help us make it known that we aren't going anywhere.""
Meanwhile, in Chicago, the early morning arrests of 175 members of a group demonstrating against corporate greed signified a new phase of civil disobedience for the city's wing of the movement, organizers said Sunday.
The arrests came after hundreds of members of Occupy Chicago refused to take down tents and leave Grant Park near the city's lakefront when it closed at 11 p.m. Saturday. Organizers did not seek a permit to be in the park after hours, saying they stayed because they need a home base for the growing movement.
On Saturday, Occupy protestors gathered all over the world. Violence broke out in Rome, where police fired tear gas and water cannons at some protestors who broke away from the main demonstration, smashing shop and bank windows, torching cars and hurtling bottles. Dozens were injured. And tens of thousands marched in cities across Europe, as the protests that began in New York linked up with long-running demonstration against government cost-cutting and failed financial policies in Europe. Protestors also turned out in Australia and Asia.
The Occupy Wall Street demonstration started out small last month, with less than a dozen college students spending days and nights in Zucotti Park, a private plaza off Broadway. It has grown significantly, however, both in New York City and elsewhere as people in other communities display their solidarity in similar protests.",1,Miami,2011-10-16

Posted: 10/17/11 at 10:10 pm EDT      Last Updated: 10/17/11 at 10:31 pm EDT


MIAMI (WSVN) -- Local community leaders are scheduled to join dozens of protesters outside the Miami-Dade Government Center Monday morning.
At 10:30 a.m., local labor and community leaders will attend a press conference in support of the Occupy Miami movement at the Stephen P. Clark Center Government Center in Downtown Miami.
This is the third day of protests and forecasters predict heavy rain into the late evening.
Despite the rain, protesters said they are not leaving until changes are made, or they are forced to leave. ""Until we get something done or the cops come and pull us out,"" said Brandon Duval.
Sunday night, close to two dozen tents were pitched in front of the government center. They're hoping this scene will give attention to their message. ""We have some in tents, and we have more tents on the way,"" said Bruce Wayne. ""We're encouraging more people to come out and bring tents and help us occupy this space.""
Over the weekend, protests in South Florida remained both large and peaceful.
Yet protesters want to remind the community of their sole purpose for protesting. ""I'm hoping to just educate people, you know,"" said Andre Silva. ""Work on making flyers; handing it out to people to let them know, maybe this current system we have going on isn't very good.""
Occupy Miami has taken to Twitter and Facebook to spread their message and promote an event that will take place Monday at the government center from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Milwaukee anti-Wall Street protest draws hundreds
MILWAUKEE (AP) Joining an internationally growing movement, hundreds of protesters marched through downtown Milwaukee on Saturday decrying corporate greed and demanding stricter regulation over the U.S.'s banking industry.
Protesters carried signs reading, ""Tax the rich"" or ""Mr. Obama, Tear Down That Wall Street,"" and many criticized the lack of government control over banks that played a role in the nation's financial crisis. The demonstration, dubbed Occupy Milwaukee, was inspired by the Occupy Wall Street protests that began in New York City before spreading to cities nationwide, from Boston to Seattle.
Even protesters in Europe, Asia and Australia took up the cause Saturday.
The Milwaukee-based group gathered at a park and marched several blocks to bank buildings. Marchers chanted ""We are 99 percent,"" a reference to the world's richest 1 percent who control billions of dollars in assets while others struggle to make ends meet.
Among the sign-wielding protestors was retired teacher Albert Siemsen, who said he grew angry watching Milwaukee schools lose funding while banks and corporations gained more influence in government.
""I would like to see more government control of financial institutions,"" the 81-year-old Milwaukee man said. ""The far right is taking over our country, and that has to stop.""
Other protesters held yellow crime-scene tape in front of the entrances of buildings housing Chase and M&I Bank branches, with police silently standing at the doors.

UPDATED 4:55 AM CDT Oct 28, 2011


MILWAUKEE —The Occupy Wall Street protest in New York has been going strong for more than a month, and protesters plan to Occupy Milwaukee for the second time this weekend.
Protesters plan to gather at Lincoln Park at noon Saturday. Police have announced street closures around the park.
""We will no longer continue to sit back and allow our elected officials to play the people. To represent big corporations instead of the interests of the people, and we will do everything that we have to do in order to send a message to say, 'No more,'"" community organizer Khalil Coleman said.
The original Occupy movement began as a protest against politicians protecting corporations at the expense of middle America. However a second group is planning on joining the Milwaukee protest.
""Occupy The Hood"" organizers said they are upset about Senate bill 207, which allows employers to fire convicted felons even if their offense is unrelated to their job.
The current law states the felony offense must be directly related.
Both groups said the bill attacks civil rights.
The first Occupy Milwaukee protest at Zeidler Park on Oct. 15 drew more than 1,000 participants.
Police believe Saturday's gathering will likely be larger than the first.
WISN 12 News asked Milwaukee police if they plan to staff additional officers at Saturday's rally in light of recent violence at similar events around the country.

October 15, 2011 4:52 PM


MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) – Hundreds of protesters demonstrating with Occupy Minnesota set up tents Friday afternoon in defiance of Hennepin County’s ban on tents in the Hennepin County Government Center plaza, where protesters have demonstrated since Oct. 7.
The protesters marched into the southern part of the government plaza at around 4:30 p.m., carrying clear, plastic tents and chanting, “We are the 99 percent.” They set up the tents on grass lawns and used clear material so that what went on inside the tents would be visible to authorities, who are watching over the protest and recording it with video cameras.
Nick Espinosa, one of the Occupy Minnesota organizers, said that the clear tents show the protesters’ desire for transparency.
“The concern we’ve been hearing is visibility, that don’t know what’s going on inside of those tents,” Espinosa said. “So we’ve found a creative solution that addresses their concerns … but also our concerns for the safety and health of everyone who’s sleeping out here.”
Espinosa said he spoke with the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office and told authorities that the protest is in no way violent and that they are willing to protest outside the government center until change comes.
None of the tent-making protesters have been arrested and the tents have remained untouched by authorities. However, the OccupyMN Facebook page said that the police were going to take down the tents soon.
In a press release Friday, authorities said that if they saw protesters putting up a tent, they would ask them to stop. If protesters refused, authorities said police would take down the tent, inventory the tent with county staff and return it to protesters at a later date.
Around the tents, protesters made a human chain. And by 7:15 p.m., it consisted of more than 100 protesters, all of which were willing to be arrested.
WCCO-TV was told police arrested a legal observer Saturday evening, but it did not appear to be in relation to the tent protest. The woman had been asked by police not to return to the protest Friday, and when she did Saturday, they arrested her.

“The concern we’ve been hearing is visibility, that don’t know what’s going on inside of those tents,” Espinosa said. “So we’ve found a creative solution that addresses their concerns … but also our concerns for the safety and health of everyone who’s sleeping out here.”
Espinosa said he spoke with the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office and told authorities that the protest is in no way violent and that they are willing to protest outside the government center until change comes.
None of the tent-making protesters have been arrested and the tents have remained untouched by authorities. However, the OccupyMN Facebook page said that the police were going to take down the tents soon.
In a press release Friday, authorities said that if they saw protesters putting up a tent, they would ask them to stop. If protesters refused, authorities said police would take down the tent, inventory the tent with county staff and return it to protesters at a later date.
Around the tents, protesters made a human chain. And by 7:15 p.m., it consisted of more than 100 protesters, all of which were willing to be arrested.
WCCO-TV was told police arrested a legal observer Saturday evening, but it did not appear to be in relation to the tent protest. The woman had been asked by police not to return to the protest Friday, and when she did Saturday, they arrested her.

Authorities take down demonstrators' tents
SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS


Anti-Wall Street protesters who had their tents forcibly removed from a Minneapolis government plaza early Tuesday morning aren't going away easily.
The Occupy Minneapolis protesters have set up a couple of tents in front of Minneapolis City Hall, where they are cheerfully greeting commuters getting off light-rail trains.
Hennepin County security employees moved in about 4 a.m. and took down 27 tents that had been set up Wednesday evening on a plaza between the county government building and City Hall. The county has forbidden the tents. Sheriff's spokeswoman Lisa Kiava (kee-YAHV'-uh) says about 45 protesters were there at the time, but no one was arrested.
Kiava says Minneapolis police have been alerted to the new tents.
The protesters have occupied the plaza since early October.",1,Minneapolis,2011-12-01

Dozens of tents were erected on the Government Center plaza.
More than three dozen OccupyMPLS  tents that occupied the northeast corner of the Hennepin County Government Center plaza in downtown Minneapolis Wednesday night were removed hours later by police. 
The tents had been erected by the protesters in defiance of county rules and a federal judge.
As the anti-Wall Street and pro-peace protesters entered their third month of round-the-clock days on the plaza, about a dozen security guards had stood earlier on the outskirts of the group, which numbered about 150 at its largest on Wednesday.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota sued the county Nov. 22 on behalf of OccupyMPLS, claiming that new rules adapted by Hennepin County banning the use of tents, electricity and signs violated the protesters' right to free speech.
The next day, Senior U.S. District Judge Richard Kyle ruled that protesters have the right to affix signs to the plaza, but he upheld the county's rules restricting their ability to use tents and chalk messages on the plaza or to sleep there overnight.
                                                                                        
Beginning at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, speaker after speaker rallied the group on the plaza. State Rep. Karen Clark, DFL-Minneapolis, told the crowd that the neighborhoods she represents, Phillips, Stevens Square and Whittier, ""helped me really understand why you are here.""
""I am in solidarity with you and know there are other public officials who are too,"" Clark said. ""You can count on us. We are here. I am here, with you, part of you. We are the 99 percent ... think a lot of people did not know that 1 percent of our people control most of the wealth in our country. You have made it clear that the class struggle is a great economic injustice.""
Several members of Veterans for Peace have stood alongside the OccupyMPLS protesters from the start and were at Wednesday night's rally.
""You keep hearing over and over again, the vets in Iraq are fighting for our freedom,"" said Barry Riesch, a Vietnam veteran. ""That's not true. These people are fighting for our freedom. This is fighting for freedom right here.""
Bruce Berry of Minneapolis said he has visited other Occupy protests across the country, some of which have been forced to disband after confrontations with local authorities. He has been at the Minneapolis protest on and off since its start in early October.
""I need to continue holding our ground,"" he said, ""to have freedom of assembly right here on our plaza, a public plaza. I don't think it says anything in the Constitution about tents.""

NASHVILLE, Tenn. – A new policy could have Occupy Nashville demonstrators off Legislative Plaza after midnight Friday. After a lengthy meeting Thursday night, members of the group decided they will not willingly leave the plaza.
That state policy could force Occupy Nashville members to leave the place they have protested for 20 days. Thursday afternoon the Department of General Services put a curfew into effect for the Capitol grounds.
The group, by consensus, decided they will continue to protest on the plaza as they have since October 7th. They understand police may try to remove them from the area.
""There's a contingent of people here prepared to risk arrest if for some reason the state deems it important to arrest people doing that act. And the other contingent who aren't able to risk arrest, will act in support of those who have been arrested,"" explained Occupy Nashville member Katy Savage.
The Legislative Plaza, War Memorial Courtyard and Capital Grounds use Policy says, ""Effective immediately… all assemblies and gatherings of persons on the State of Tennessee Legislative Plaza, War Memorial Courtyard and Capital ground area in Nashville, Tennessee shall require a use permit from the Tennessee Department of General Services.""
All demonstrations must be approved after an application and satisfaction of use fees.
If granted a permit, demonstrations are only allowed during the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
Just after 4:00 p.m. Thursday, state workers posted signs around instructing the rules of the new curfew saying, no one is allowed on Legislative Plaza from 10:00 p.m. to  6:00 a.m., which goes into effect on Friday October 28, 2011.
The new state policy also requires groups to now have a permit before they can gather on the Capitol grounds. That permit cost $65 and makes security and insurance liabilities the applying group's responsibility.
By consensus, the members of Occupy Nashville decided they would not apply for a state permit to congregate on Legislative Plaza.",1,Nashville,2011-10-28

Occupy Nashville Rally at Public Square Park: More than 200 rally in Public Square Park for Occupy Nashville Saturday.

Hundreds of marchers from across Tennessee converged Saturday in Nashville to protest what they see as a country where corporations have more of a voice in government than citizens do.
“Occupy Wall Street, Occupy Nashville, occupy everything and never give it back,” protesters chanted during a city-sanctioned march that threaded a six-block loop between the Metro Courthouse and Legislative Plaza.
The march was one of many held in cities around the country and globe to support the ongoing Occupy Wall Street protests in New York. A small group of protesters in Nashville has been occupying Legislative Plaza for the past week and plans to continue doing so indefinitely.
Before the march came a rally, in which participants took turns sharing their stories. Three generations of the Warren family drove down from Lobelville, Tenn., to say their piece.
Michael Warren took his place in the center of the gathering and spoke his piece — the protesters chanting back every sentence so his words carried to the far edges o f the crowd of 200-plus.
“ Things are not right, and they don’t appear to be getting better,” said Warren, who wrote to his senators and Rep. Marsha Blackburn but said he received only form letters in response to his story. The family lives in Perry County, where the unemployment rate hit 25 percent in 2009. Warren’s wife and daughter operated a thriving small business that went under when the economy tanked.
“We’re doing everything right and we’re getting nowhere,” said his daughter, Emily Weight, whose company, Nana’s Jetpack, sold baby carriers that she and her mother designed and sewed, shipping them to stores around the country. “I’m here because I want some change.”
'Keep it peaceful'
Saturday’s rally was an orderly affair. Marchers threaded up Deaderick Street to Sixth Avenue, looped around to Union and marched back to the courthouse. There was no visible police presence, and the marchers took pains to stay on the sidewalk and stick to the route outlined on the permit issued by the city.
“I feel people here are really sincere about wanting a change for peace and justice,” said Salina Khan of Murfreesboro, who came to the rally with her husband and daughters Fatima, 9, Aleeza, 5, and Sakina Razzaq, 4. The girls colored her protest sign: “United Against Injustice.”
When it was Khan’s turn to speak, she urged the crowd: “Don’t let them divide us by religion, race or social class. We will win if we stay as one.”
Over the past week, Occupy Nashville has made itself at home on Legislative Plaza. Newer and lower-key than its Wall Street counterparts, the group provides its members with food, shelter, and medical and legal assistance as they camp out on the hard granite of one of Nashville’s most public places.
The Southern Festival of Books obligingly carved out a space for the occupation this weekend. Sleeping bags and tables of food are tucked away behind the festival’s tents and performance spaces.
“We want to keep it civil, keep it peaceful, keep it mature,” said protester Phillip Schlicher, standing next to a table of donated food and a sign outlining the rules for participating in the protest: Throw away your trash and recycle your recyclables; respect others who use the plaza; speak for yourself, not the group.
Occupy Nashville is a leaderless organization, with decisions made by group consensus — and anyone who wants to take part can come down and participate in the daily assemblies, held at 1 p.m. on weekends in the plaza and 7 on weeknights.
Jacob Kaset, a Nashville landscaper, comes down to the protest every night after work. It reminds him of the Vietnam protest era.
“I have no idea where this (movement) is going, but we can’t keep going the way we are,” he said. “Where people are working a job and a half and they still can’t make ends meet.”",1,Nashville,2011-10-16

'Occupy' protests swell nationwide; dozens arrested
BYLINE: CNN
LENGTH: 1252 words
DATELINE: NEW YORK (CNN)


NEW YORK (CNN) --  Protests swelled in cities nation-wide Friday, as police forces around the country struggled to either corral or remove demonstrators from downtown parks and plazas in the latest development of the month-long ""Occupy Wall Street"" movement.
Dozens were arrested in Denver, San Diego and New York, while similar demonstrations were scheduled to take place in Washington, Orlando, Atlanta and Detroit. CNN iReporters sent in photos and video from ""occupy"" protests across several American cities.
In San Diego, CNN affiliate KFMB broadcast images of police detaining demonstrators as they gathered amid tents and tarps strewn about a downtown plaza.
Protesters appeared to refuse to leave the area, sitting in columns atop the tarps and yelling, ""Stay down"" as police tried to remove them from the scene.
In Denver, authorities say 24 people were arrested as CNN affiliate KMGH broadcast aerial video of police detaining protesters in a downtown section of the city.
Colorado State Police patrol spokesman Mike Baker said the demonstration could be broken down into two distinct groups: The first was a part of what he described as the original ""Occupy"" group, which maintained close communication with law enforcement. The second, he said, was a more ""radical"" faction.
""These were the ones (police) came into trouble with today,"" Baker said.
Most in Denver were charged for unlawful conduct on state property, he added, while one other person was charged for simple assault. Another protester was arrested for impeding traffic.
In New York , Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said police had arrested 14 demonstrators, after they sat down in roadways and blocked traffic, overturned trash bins, knocked over a police scooter and hurled bottles.
Wesleyan University student Ben Doernberg, who attended Friday's protest in Manhattan's financial district, shot video of at least one other demonstrator being hauled to the ground by police.
The video captures a police officer pressing his night stick against the back of the protester's neck during the arrest, while the man is seen faced down on the pavement.
The protester can be heard screaming in what Doernberg described as an earlier incident in which the man's leg was allegedly run over by a police motorcycle.
""I saw a number of other people being shoved or pushed with batons,"" Doernberg said. ""I saw another officer punching people.""
New York police were not immediately available for comment on the allegation and CNN cannot independently verify the claim.
Later on Friday, hip hop mogul Russell Simmons called the demonstrations ""inspirational.""
""People want this country to be better,"" he told CNN. ""They want the money out of Washington,"" adding that he believed the U.S. government remains largely controlled by corporations.
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said earlier Friday that Brookfield Office Properties -- the real-estate firm that owns Zuccotti Park, considered a home-base for protesters -- made the decision not to clear them out after the company was ""inundated"" with threatening calls from elected city officials.
The mayor said during his weekly commentary on New York's WOR Radio that he didn't know which officials allegedly made the threats, but that the company decided to work out some form of a negotiated settlement with protesters in the coming days.
Bloomberg added that while he lacked first-hand knowledge of the conversations, he was told the officials generally threatened to ""make life more difficult"" for the real-estate company.
Brookfield Properties issued a statement later Friday saying ""a number of local political leaders"" requested the cleaning of the park be deferred for ""a short period of time.""
The cancellation averts a broader showdown between authorities and demonstrators, who appeared heartened by news of the cancellation.
""We are winning and Wall Street is afraid,"" protester Kira Moyer-Sims said in a written statement distributed by the group. ""This movement is gaining momentum and is too big to fail.""
Bloomberg's office announced earlier that the real-estate firm withdrew their request made earlier in the week for police assistance during the scheduled clean-up operation.
""Our position has been consistent throughout: the City's role is to protect public health and safety, to enforce the law, and guarantee the rights of all New Yorkers. Brookfield believes they can work out an arrangement with the protesters that will ensure the park remains clean, safe, available for public use and that the situation is respectful of residents and businesses downtown, and we will continue to monitor the situation,"" said Deputy Mayor Cas Holloway.
The demonstrations have been mostly peaceful, though there had been fears of a standoff between police officers tasked with clearing the park and protesters who said they wouldn't budge.
City officials in New York had initially ordered the protesters to leave by 7 a.m.
But the demonstrators mopped, collected trash and scrubbed the pavement in the dead of the night as the Friday deadline neared for them to leave the premises for a cleanup. When the word of the postponed cleaning filtered through the more than 1,000 protesters who filled the park, they were elated.
The protesters, who have been chanting ""All day! All week! Occupy Wall Street,"" called the development a victory and planned to continue their passive resistance, ""We're extremely excited.This is an example of what people power can do,"" Tyler Combelic, a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street. ""This is what democracy is all about in this country,""
Protesters descended on the privately-owned park near the New York Stock Exchange on September 17 to protest the nation's ailing economy.
""You want to clean up something? Clean up these crooks on Wall Street,"" said City Council Member Charles Barron.
Councilwoman Letitia James of Brooklyn said the move to clean the park was a ""ruse"" to end the protest.
Bloomberg told protesters Wednesday that the decision to clean the park was made after owners voiced concerns about ""unsanitary conditions and considerable wear and tear on the park.""
""The mayor is a strong believer in the First Amendment and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest,"" Holloway said in an earlier statement.
But the situation in the park is ""not in the best interests of the protesters, residents or the city,"" he said.
The plan had been to clean the park in stages, and protesters would be allowed to return to the park as areas were cleaned if they obeyed the rules set forth by the owners, Brookfield Properties, the statement said.
""The park has not been cleaned in four weeks, a process that is normally undertaken every night,"" Brookfield said in a statement. ""Our goal is to keep the park clean, safe, and accessible to all.""
Zuccotti Park was built for the general public, but the weeks-long protest has raised concerns among area business owners and residents about sanitation.
The protest campaign began in July with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and a sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange.
For about a month, demonstrations have addressed such issues as police brutality, union busting and the economy, the group said.
Organizers have taken inspiration from this year's Arab Spring protests that swept through North Africa ad the Middle East. Crowds have taken up residence in the park in New York's financial district, and organizers have called for 20,000 people to flood the area for a ""few months.""

EXCLUSIVE


It’s the Autumn of Love!
Occupy Wall Street protesters are flocking to nearby health clinics for STD and HIV testing after getting their freak on in ’60s-style hookups with crusty strangers, sources told The Post yesterday.
“Last week was free love,” said a medical professional at a clinic located a short walk from Zuccotti Park, referring to the number of people who organizers have referred for sexually transmitted disease testing.
A volunteer at the park admitted concern among protesters about STDs.
“We give directions to clinics if people ask for information regarding STDs,” said the volunteer, who identified himself only as “Captain” and added that pregnancy tests are also a hot item.
“Like anything else, it happens. People ask, and we do the best we can for them.”
Volunteers at the medical tent hand out cash, usually $15 or $20, so the randy radicals can visit clinics that cater to a low-income clientele, the source said.
Experts said it’s the right thing to do.
“My advice for the protesters would be to practice safer sex. It’s a lot cheaper to buy a condom than get treated for an STD,” said Dr. Lisa Oldson, medical director of Chicago-based Analyte Health, which provides testing services for labs nationwide, including STD Test Express New York.
Also yesterday, a man who was punched in the head by a NYPD deputy inspector met with prosecutors to try to have the cop charged with misdemeanor assault.
“Nobody is claiming that this is the crime of the century, but what he did ... was assault,” said Ron Kuby, the lawyer for Felix Rivera-Pitre, who was hit by Deputy Inspector John Cardona in an incident caught on video.
Meanwhile, more than 100 protesters joined last night’s Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village, with several dressed as “corporate zombies.”",1,NewYork,2011-11-01

Occupy Wall Street Protesters Rally Against ""Excessive Force""
By: Nicole Ward


Their fight over corporate greed isn't over yet, but protesters who've been camped out in Lower Manhattan for two weeks are now taking on a new issue.
Demonstrators marched from their main gathering point in Zuccotti Park to police headquarters Friday to shine light on what they say is excessive force used by the department.
Several people were maced and about 80 people arrested for disorderly conduct last weekend.
The department is now investigating.
Protesters said that people in positions of authority should not abuse their power.
""I saw what happened to the people getting sprayed with pepper spray and them trying to regulate people's right to free speech, the right to assemble,"" said one protester.
""The people that are here, you know, we want to make a difference, we want to make changes,"" said another.
For the first time, a major labor union joined the protest, which has since moved back to Zuccotti Park.
Transport Workers Local 100 representatives say the state's wealthiest residents should pay their fair share.
""We feel it's also unjust, you know the fat cats get fatter and the poor get poorer,"" said manager Taul Flores of the Transport Workers Union. ""We just want our fair share like everybody else.”",2,NewYork,2011-09-30

A new wave of student activism hits New York City
A A A Comments (5)By Rosie Gray Wednesday, Dec 7 2011


At the beginning of November, Cooper Union students held an ""Open Forum"" outside their Foundation building on Cooper Square. They didn't want to call it a walkout. For an afternoon, students and professors sat outside and huddled under blankets while doing homework and writing on a chalkboard. The issue: the suggestion by Cooper Union's president that the school might, for the first time in its history, have to charge tuition like other schools do. The walkout wrapped up later on indoors with a speech from new president Jamshed Bharucha.
Later that month, City University of New York students threw down with police during a rally at Baruch College, a few subway stops north of where the Cooper Union walkout had occurred. It was timed to coincide with a hearing of the CUNY board of trustees to discuss a new round of proposed tuition hikes. Students refused to leave the lobby of Baruch as the trustees met upstairs, and the police moved in. ""We could hear the screams of people getting beat,"" says Fernanda Pardo, 23, a student organizer at John Jay College who was upstairs waiting outside the hearing. ""We were hysterical and crying."" Fifteen were arrested and detained.
Both protests were part of a current resurgence in student activism in New York that has coincided with the Occupy Wall Street action—there was also a short-lived New School occupation, and there has been some activity from something called NYU 4 OWS. The activism at New York City colleges is filling the void as OWS struggles to find its way, but it's taking different forms across town.
A large portion of Cooper's money comes from its real estate holdings, the value of which has been dropping. The school has had to resort to selling off assets and skimming off the principal of its endowment in order to continue its no-tuition policy.
Cooper senior Ryan Evell told the Voice last month that ""if Cooper starts charging tuition, that would be as radical as Harvard saying that everyone who gets in gets a full scholarship."" Evell also referred to the possible tuition charges as a ""sad loss not just for New York but for the entire nation."" But the school that's ""as free as air and water"" is the only one of its kind in the country, and its policy is starting to look quaint, especially for a small private school in the middle of an economic downturn.
A public institution designed to serve New York City's working class, CUNY hasn't been free since 1975, and it is increasingly less free as time goes on. The board of trustees approved a new set of tuition hikes on November 28, which will raise tuition by 31 percent over five years. This will manifest as a $300 increase each year.
Students at CUNY campuses saw the writing on the wall months ago and formed Students United for a Free CUNY over the summer. Their timing matched up to the origins of Occupy Wall Street, which in its early phase was a series of General Assemblies attended by organizers in Tompkins Square Park. The CUNY group consists of around 20 organizers from campuses across the city, including Pardo and Venetia Biney, a 22-year-old junior at Hunter College.
""I work full-time and go to school full-time,"" says Biney, a third-generation CUNY student. Of the tuition hikes, she said ""it's going to affect me immensely because I don't have my mom and dad to rely on.""
That's a common story at CUNY, where many, if not most, students are working one or multiple jobs on top of classes, like Sarah Pomar, 25, a junior sociology major at Hunter, who has two jobs and pays out of pocket for school. She has had to move back in with her parents.
""CUNY is a working-class public institution,"" Pomar says. ""You can justifiably assume that a lot of students are experiencing a lot of financial hardship.""
CUNY says it gives financial aid of some kind to 70 percent of full-time undergraduate students—but the 30 percent left over in a system that includes close to 500,000 people is considerable. And under the new rules, qualifying for financial aid will become more difficult. As an aside, it's worth noting that CUNY chancellor Matthew Goldstein 's salary has nearly doubled in the past decade.
These are specific and targeted complaints directed toward a single entity, the type of messaging that Occupy Wall Street has famously never managed nor wanted to come up with. Pomar and others involved in Students United for a Free CUNY cited OWS as an inspiration, but not as a cause, for their actions against what Pardo called the ""gentrification of CUNY.""
""Occupy Wall Street provided a place for all these social justice movements to intersect and build,"" Pomar says. This has been on display at the CUNY protests, which lately include a strong union presence and a smattering of original Occupy Wall Streeters.
At the end of November, those unions and OWS people joined up with CUNY students for a large rally at Baruch while the board of trustees voted on the tuition hikes. The hikes passed. Meanwhile, students at Cooper Union organized an art show at the Foundation building about free tuition. It ran for four days to little buzz.
Even without better results, Fernanda Pardo, the John Jay student, feels encouraged. ""People are starting to get the hint.""",1,NewYork,2011-12-07

Richmond mayor marches to support Oakland strike
BYLINE: By Karl Fischer Contra Costa Times
SECTION: BREAKING; My Town; Alameda; Contra Costa; News; Local
LENGTH: 323 words


A dozen progressives, led  part way by Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, on
Wednesday marched from Richmond to downtown Oakland in support of Occupy Oakland
and the general strike.
""It was absolutely worth it,"" Marilyn Langlois, an aide to McLaughlin, said of
the roughly 10-mile trek. ""There was a lot of support along the way.""
The marchers were mostly members of the Richmond Progressive Alliance and
carried a banner that read ""Occupy Oakland."" It took more than three hours,
marching along San Pablo Avenue, to reach the strike's epicenter at Frank H.
Ogawa Plaza.
McLaughlin walked through Richmond with the group before returning to city
business.
""We are marching in solidarity with the Occupy Oakland movement. We stand for
the 99 percent that the system is failing,"" McLaughlin said Wednesday morning.
McLaughlin also took a verbal poke at her Oakland counterpart, Jean Quan, for
allowing Oakland's police department to forcefully roust protesters last week, a
clash that made international headlines.
""We really are at a crossroads here. As an elected official, you need to know
which side you are on, or you will get caught in the intersection, as Jean Quan
did,"" McLaughlin said.
The Richmond mayor and other progressives said the widening gulf between rich
and poor, both in terms of money and influence, frustrates most Americans.
""In Richmond, we have two prominent representatives of the 1 percent,"" said Juan
Reardon, of the Richmond Progressive Alliance. ""We have banks, and we have
Chevron.""
The march began at Macdonald and San Pablo avenues, an intersection that
features a Chevron station and two branches of large national banks. Protesters
unfurled a large Occupy Chevron banner to accompany their Occupy Oakland banner
before setting off.
""This is where the '60s and '70s left off,"" McLaughlin said as she walked. ""This
is the next step. They're honking and waving because they know what this is
about. This is the real thing.""

BYLINE: Oakland Tribune
SECTION: MY TOWN; Alameda; News; Local


7:43 p.m. Protesters hit by car
Protesters marching from Frank Ogawa Plaza to the Port of Oakland have been hit
by a car. The extent of their injuries is unknown.
7:40 p.m. Protesters set up driver check points at port
The intersection at Seventh and Maritime streets is almost like a rebel
checkpoint. Every car that comes through is stopped while protesters question
the driver, then debate with the larger group about whether they should be
allowed to pass.
""He's a worker,"" a protester at a car will shout to the group. ""He's trying to
get home.""
Then, they await the larger answer: ""Let him go through,"" the crowd replies, and
the driver is allowed on his or her way.
Protesters, however, are refusing to let television news trucks through.
""They work for the 1 percent,"" the crowd will shout. ""We can tell our own
story.""
-- Paul T. Rosynsky
7:35 p.m. Protesters try to block news truck from leaving
At Seventh and Maritime streets, protesters argued briefly over whether to let a
CBS5 news truck leave the port, with several protesters blocking the path.
Others are urging them to let the truck leave.
7:25 p.m. Google map corrected
Frank Ogawa Plaza is no longer called ""Oscar Grant Plaza"" on Google maps. The
change was apparently a user contribution that has since been corrected.
7:18 p.m. Port workers try to arrive for night shift
The Pacific Maritime Association requested 200 stevedores to work the night
shift at the port, and those workers are making every attempt to get work, said
Craig Merriless, spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.
7:15 p.m.: Stragglers continue to head toward port
At 14th and Broadway, a drum circle and a truck begin heading east on Broadway,
with the intention of circling around City Hall, then heading toward the port.
Hundreds are following.
7:01 p.m. Port workers try to leave
Some port workers express visible support for the strike while others became
entangled with testy exchanges with the protesters as the workers tried to leave
the port.
At Maritime Street and Middle Harbor Road, one truck driver said he was angered
by the dozen people who had occupied the roof of his trailer. His shift began at
4 a.m. and he wanted to get home to San Jose.
""It's his truck. He's not the problem,"" said protester Erica Lee, who works at a
coffee import business in West Oakland.
Another protester yelled for the people on the trailer to get off, expanding
that the driver was paid by a truckload and they should not alienate the port
workers.
The crowd, however, was only getting larger and it appeared the driver would be
stuck there for several hours. A brass band played on the street outside and one
sign carried up to the trailer said, ""Be excellent to each other.""
""There are some truckers that are probably pretty cool with it,"" Lee said. ""I
saw some who were stoked. But some people are probably getting annoyed.""
--Matt O'Brien
6:50 p.m. Meanwhile, back at the plaza....
Union workers are hosting a huge cookout.
6:40 p.m. Police retreating from port
Police are pulling away from the line of protesters at the port. Officers remain
in the command center, but they are not longer blocking the line of bicyclists.
6:30 p.m. Support arrives from county sheriff's office
Vanloads of officers from the Alameda County Sheriff's Department and unmarked
SWAT vans have arrived at the OPD command center at the Port.
Some officers are heading to the nearby EBMUD facility.
6:18 p.m. Brief standoff with police, protesters at port
About 50 police officers wearing riot gear have formed a line at Maritime and
Bataan roads, near the OPD command center. Some have shotguns with tear-gas
canisters equipped. About a dozen motorcycle officers are forming a line behind
them. All the officers appear to be from the Oakland Police Department.
About a dozen protesters on bicycles are facing off in front of the officers,
including one wearing a bandanna to cover his face. Other protesters on foot are
heading that way.
6:25 p.m. Crowd grows by thousands
Thousands of people are continuing to stream over the bridge onto Adeline
Street, blanketing all four lanes.
The crowd continues to be peaceful. It includes many bands and children, with no
anarchists in sight.
6:13 p.m: Port workers try to leave
Some port workers are leaving taking 7th Street instead of Harbor Road, which is
filled with people.
Some disputed there was any violence, but blamed the media for reporting it.
6 p.m. Port entrance
About 3,000 of people were stopped at the port entrance for about 40 minutes,
before moving into the port. Thousands more people were surging over the bridge
onto Adeline Street.
The crowd was peaceful, with people playing music, smoking marijuana and
standing on top of trucks that were parked in the crowd.",2,Oakland,2011-11-02

Oakland police: Two thirds of general strike arrestees were from out of town
BYLINE: By Kristin J. Bender, Angela Woodall, and Doug Oakley Oakland Tribune
SECTION: MY TOWN; Alameda; News; Local
LENGTH: 632 words


OAKLAND -- The results and ramifications of the Nov. 2 Occupy Oakland general
strike are slowly coming into focus less than 48 hours after thousands of protesters filled the streets downtown and shut down the Port of Oakland.
A second veteran of the Iraq War was injured and in stable condition at Highland
Hospital.
Kayvan Sabehgi, 32, was in fair condition Friday evening in the intensive care
unit.
The Guardian is reporting that he told them he was beaten by police during a
clash with law enforcement after the strike. But his allegations have not been
verified by authorities.
Another veteran, Scott Olsen, was also taken to Highland after suffering a
severe fracture to his skull during an Oct. 25 protest.
The spirit of the Occupy movement and general strike, however, continued Friday
when a group of moms and their children called the ""Colorful Mamas of the 99
Percent"" tried to enter Wells Fargo Bank in downtown.
The group supported both the Occupy Wall Street and Bank Transfer Day movements.
At least three moms closed their accounts before the bank locked its doors in
response to the protest, which began about noon at the branch on Franklin
Street.
Meanwhile, the city is still tallying the cost for police and city services
utilized during the strike, which was fairly peaceful, though windows at
municipal buildings at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza were broken, Whole Foods was damaged
and sprayed with graffiti and other downtown banks and businesses were
vandalized.
The tab to replace 18 broken windows in municipal buildings in the plaza is
estimated at $20,000 to $25,000, city officials said.
And about two-thirds of the 103 people arrested during melees that followed late
Wednesday and early Thursday were not from Oakland. People taken into custody
for failure to disperse and facing other charges came from as far away as Texas,
Michigan, New York, Utah, New Jersey and Oregon.
Just before midnight Wednesday, a group of people that police are calling
anarchists started fires, tossed firecrackers into burning fires, broke windows
and caused other destruction downtown. Most of the 103 people arrested were
taken in for remaining at ""the place of any riot, rout, or unlawful assembly,
after they have been warned to disperse,"" authorities said.
Others were arrested and accused of resisting arrest, assault with a deadly
weapon, vandalism, battery on a police officer and a parole violation.
Of the 103 arrested, 32 are from Oakland, 42 are from other Bay Area cities, 15
are from other parts of California and nine are from out of state. Two of those
arrested were 17-year-old juveniles who were cited and released. One is from
Washington, the other from San Mateo County. Hometowns for three of those
arrested were not released. Of those arrested, 92 were cited and 11 were kept in
custody.
BART reported unusually heavy ridership Wednesday because so many people took
trains to the rallies. Some 391,000 rode BART, compared with 370,000 on a
typical weekday, said district spokesman Jim Allison. About 6,100 more than
usual passengers exited the Oakland 12th Street station, he said
The group of 40 moms and children marched from Snow Park by Lake Merritt, where
Occupy Oakland protesters still maintain about a dozen tents.
The 300 or so people living in the downtown camp arose Friday morning to chilly
temperatures but promised to stick it out, rain or shine. They have been
collecting blankets and extra tarps to keep out the rain and cold. People
wandered around the camp Friday with their hoods up, drinking hot coffee and
trying to stay warm.
""I can survive any weather,"" said Kenaja Mwari, 23, of Oakland. Gesturing toward
City Hall, he added ""If we aren't going to let the people stop us, why would we
let some weather stop us?""

Experts question shooting of Occupy Oakland filmer
SECTION: DOMESTIC NEWS
LENGTH: 320 words
DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.


An Oakland man says a police officer shot him with a rubber bullet or beanbag
while he was videotaping last week's standoff between law enforcement and a
small group that took over a building and lit fires after a day of peaceful
anti-Wall Street protests.
Experts in police use of force who reviewed the footage Scott Campbell captured
say it appears the volley was unprovoked and inappropriate, the Oakland Tribune
reported Tuesday (http://bit.ly/rQfuLG).
In the video posted on YouTube (http://bit.ly/sFSYJP), Campbell, 30, is heard
calling, ""Is this OK?"" to a line of riot gear-clad officers. He told the
newspaper that he was asking if his distance from them was adequate because an
officer had asked him to step back. A firearm held by an officer then is seen
going off, followed by Campbell's yelps of pain.
The Oakland Police Department, which also has been criticized for wounding an
Iraq War veteran during an Oct. 25 skirmish, did not respond to a request for
comment.
University of South Carolina criminal justice professor Geoffrey Alpert said
that unless something occurred off-camera to provoke the officer, the shooting
was ""one of the most outrageous uses of a firearm"" he'd ever seen.
""Unless there's a threat that you can't see in the video, that just looks like
absolute punishment, which is the worst type of excessive force,"" Alpert said.
Campbell, who identifies himself as an anarchist, said he took video of the
confrontation that occurred early Nov. 3 because he wanted to document any
instances of excessive force, but did not imagine that he would be a target.
Authorities have said they moved to arrest more than 100 people and used tear
gas and beanbags after a small group of self-proclaimed anarchists entered a
vacant building with bottles and flares and then lit fires in the street when
officers tried to clear the building.

Occupy movements in Bay Area seek life after encampments
BYLINE: By Sean Maher Bay Area News Group
SECTION: BREAKING; My Town; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; Contra Costa; News; Local
LENGTH: 928 words


SAN FRANCISCO -- Growing concerned that mayhem is overwhelming their message,
weary Occupy members in the Bay Area say police raids on encampments across the
nation have forced a question: How dependent is the movement on its public
camps?
The 2-month-old Occupy movement remains leaderless, but many members have
expressed a desire to see its focus move to demands for economic reform instead
of free speech rights and police crackdowns on encampments. Teach-ins at City
Hall, referendum petition drives and the occupation of neighborhoods and
foreclosed properties are just some of the ideas being considered as the next
phase of action.
""I'm hoping it's not necessary to put down tents again,"" said Jasper Gregory, a
member of Occupy Oakland. ""I hope that people can organize and come together for
a meeting without having to have people down there all the time. If we have to
have that encampment, then this can be stopped.""
Scott Rossi, 31, a member of Occupy San Francisco, agreed, saying, ""We can't
rely on the camps to always be a permanent fixture.
""So I think it's time to start thinking of the camps as the dot at the bottom of
an exclamation point, and the rest of the movement as the upstroke. It's time to
draw that line.""
Though the protest began over economic disparity and corporate influence in
government, Occupy Wall Street has seen much of the media coverage in the past
month focus on clashes between campers and police, with free speech rights
stealing the spotlight as the movement's central issue. Occupy Oakland, Occupy
San Jose and Occupy Cal have seen their encampments forcibly removed by police,
and many protesters have cited police brutality and infringement on their free
speech rights. Occupy San Francisco has received many warnings by city officials
to disband.
""So we're carrying two torches right now: social economic justice and the First
Amendment stuff,"" Rossi said. ""It's diluted the message.""
Henry Gage Jr., an Occupy San Jose participant, said work never stopped on the
economic issues, despite the shift in media attention.
""If battles with occupiers and the police fall to the background, more of the
real story will come out,"" Gage said. ""I think people will be pleasantly
surprised.""
Despite that, there have been clear problems with public drunkenness, hostility
and vandalism in the camps.
Police crackdowns might be a blessing, many occupiers say, because even if
encampments are permanently stymied, the energy they built can be redirected
onto a clean slate.
Rossi said he believes the energy already generated can sustain the movement,
especially if organizers continue using Internet tools, such as Twitter and
InterOccupy.org .
""This is the first Internet-fueled revolution we've seen,"" Rossi said.
There's talk about breaking the encampments into smaller, more
neighborhood-based occupations. ""Occupy the Hood"" efforts are under way in
Oakland and other cities nationwide.
Talk has also surfaced of shifting the movement indoors or onto private
property.
Occupy Oakland members voted days after their eviction from Frank H. Ogawa Plaza
on Monday to move to Henry J. Kaiser park, across from the Fox Theater. Many
protesters see it as a logical step to focus on occupying foreclosed properties.
""I'm sure that can be fairly successful in the suburbs,"" Rossi said, suggesting
an emphasis on getting families back into their foreclosed homes.
The first example of a foreclosure occupation was the short-lived mob takeover
of a foreclosed downtown building in Oakland that once housed a homeless
services center.
""That example was poorly planned and poorly thought-out, which is why it
collapsed,"" Rossi said.
Should the movement's focus turn to foreclosures, the police response will be
even more complex, said interim Oakland police Chief Howard Jordan.
""If they go into a foreclosed home, we have to get the banks or whoever owns the
property to agree they don't want them there,"" Jordan said. ""If they're in an
open lot, we still have to get owners' permission to remove them. When it's on
public property, by comparison, we have a clear reason to arrest them.""
That distinction opens the door, some occupiers say, to better engaging the
middle class.
""I think the important thing on this is they have the support of the community,""
Gregory said. ""I think if they take these actions, people need to canvass the
neighborhood. We have to knock on doors and say, 'This woman who was your
neighbor, we're moving her back in. Are you OK with that?' You have to get the
good will of the neighbors. That's vital, crucial to making this work.""
Even if forced occupations fail, other options abound, Gage said. He said he has
already seen people in San Jose parking their cars in public with tents set up
on the vehicles' roofs as a signal of solidarity, and he foresees regular
teach-ins and ballot campaigns surviving the demise of encampments.
But many occupiers and observers say the encampments remain a critical part of
the movement.
""I've got friends who think this is a disaster, that police have been successful
in evicting camps, that they're going to neuter the movement because it has lost
the one thing they had which was predictable: a visible presence,"" said Robert
Bulman, a sociology professor at Saint Mary's College in Moraga.
As encampments across the nation become fewer, can the movement survive beyond
the tents?
""That's the challenge,"" Gregory said. ""If you do pull up stakes, how do you make
sure people come back and participate?""

OAKLAND -- Dozens of new tents sprang up outside Oakland City Hall on Friday, a sight that encouraged some Occupy Wall Street supporters but infuriated others, who expressed frustration at the city's about-face on the encampment.
In a matter of weeks, Oakland has welcomed campers at Frank Ogawa Plaza, warned them to leave, forcibly removed them, blocked their return and then allowed them to retake the grounds.
""It seems like every other day has a new set of rules,"" said Greg McConnell, president of the Jobs and Housing Coalition, which represents the city's largest companies.
Asked about the mixed messages, Mayor Jean Quan said Friday she feels the city has been clear. ""We're being pretty consistent,"" she said. ""We're asking them not to camp."" A day earlier, Quan was booed away by protesters when she tried to make a speech.
On Friday, interim Police Chief Howard Jordan explained the latest rule: Police will not enter the camp unless there is a call for service.
By Friday evening, the rag-tag conglomeration at the plaza had grown from a few tents in the morning to about 60, and the lawn was covered almost as completely as it had been before Tuesday morning's police raid cleared the camp. At 9 p.m., campers were setting up tents and building a pathway that followed the route of one in the original encampment.
The California Nurses Association set up a tent in one corner near the impromptu day care center, and a small kitchen was again serving the homeless and other campers.
Impact on business
Nearby, small merchants complained that the camp has hurt their businesses, and they fear that a ""general strike"" called by protesters for Wednesday could further discourage customers. Meanwhile, big companies said the street protests affected their daily operations, and some Oakland residents said they were worried that police, busy with protesters, are even less able to respond to crimes in their neighborhoods.
What business owners said they fear is that the camp will devolve into chaos again, something some said has already begun.
The owner of Sankofa African Arts and Jewelry said that on the two mornings since protesters returned, her front doorway has reeked of urine.
She said her business has declined by 80 percent since Occupy Oakland began.
""I really, really want them to leave,"" said the owner, who gave only her first name, Ellen. She has owned her business for 17 years. ""What they are doing is making business worse.""
A camp supporter overheard her lament and shouted: ""You would have lost your business anyway with the way the economy is going.""
Ellen burst into tears.
Moji Ghafouri said business has gone down 25 percent at her Caffe Teatro. Protesters also smashed one of her windows.
""I'm a small business,"" she said. ""If you're against corporations or big business, I'm not them.""
Ghafouri said part of the problem is City Hall's doublespeak - like banning people from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. and then letting people camp overnight anyway.
""If they're not going to enforce it, don't say it,"" she said.
Wiljago Cook, 33, who set up her tent Friday, said the problems at the camp are endemic to downtown Oakland.
Because of Occupy Oakland, she said, ""a lot of things that happen in Oakland have been brought to light.""
Occupy Oakland is the latest demonstration to affect downtown businesses. At two 2010 demonstrations to protest the killing of unarmed BART passenger Oscar Grant, many downtown businesses shut early. A March 2010 protest against higher education cuts closed Interstate 880 during the evening rush hour when marchers moved to the freeway.
On Tuesday, the city advised business owners to ask employees to come in late because of the planned raid of the Occupy camp.
""If there's a protest every six months, nobody is going to come downtown,"" said a property owner in the area who works closely with business groups.
Far from downtown, other Oaklanders see the protests as taking up too much of the city's resources in a time when there are already too few. Parks, recreation centers, senior centers and police have all been cut in recent years.
Larry Benson, 54, has been unemployed for three years, so he supports the cause. But the North Oakland resident, the chairman of his neighborhood crime council, says the camp is affecting the whole city.
""This mayor should never have allowed camping at Frank Ogawa Plaza,"" he said, while also criticizing Tuesday's raid and the subsequent clashes with protesters. ""It continues to cost us. We are having a rash of burglaries over here, and the police are not responding.""
Michael Moore ecstatic
As the camp grew in size Friday, filmmaker Michael Moore flew in to pump up supporters.
As he made his way to the front of the plaza, he was swarmed by many of the gathered 1,000 or so protesters screaming, ""We love you, Michael!"" and ""Thank you!""
Moore's talk was like pouring honey on the plaza. They ate it up, and he clearly enjoyed them.
""Occupy Oakland! Occupy everywhere! I am honored to be here!"" he yelled through a microphone.
As he ticked off a litany of the complaints that spawned the Occupy movement - lack of health care, economic disparity, corporate greed, joblessness, reduced wages - the crowd roared its approval.
""This is a leaderless movement with tens of millions of people,"" said Moore, who flew in to Oakland to address a booksellers convention. ""Weather is not going to stop us.""",1,Oakland,2011-10-28

“Occupy Orlando” group rallies to end corporate greed
ORLANDO, Fla. — 
Hundreds of people packed downtown Orlando Wednesday night with one message: stop corporate greed.
The group called Occupy Orlando said it is  making plans for another protest. It's part of a national movement that started on Wall Street and is spreading across the country.
Nearly 400 people rallied downtown Wednesday night and now the group is planning a protest march for next Saturday.
WFTV found out that some of the protesters are part of the hacker group Anonymous that's accused of attacking several Orlando websites.
Several members of Food Not Bombs helped coordinate Wednesday night's event.
Organizers said even TEA party members are welcome.
""There are so many groups out here. We're standing in solidarity with each other, no matter whether you're leaning to the left or to the right. We are fed up,"" said one group member who did not want to be named.
The group is named after and aligned with the Occupy Wall Street protesters that have held events in New York City since last month.
""We are baseline, tired of one percent of the population being able to control with money, the other 99 percent,"" said one group member.
Organizers refused to give WFTV their real names, saying they want to remain anonymous because they're afraid of getting threats about the new protest organization.
The group said it’s planning Occupation of Orlando on Oct.15, beginning at the Orlando Chamber of Commerce, a symbol they believe of corporate greed.
One of the ideas the group promoted is a $20 an hour minimum wage.",1,Orlando,2011-10-05
466,5498,"Without permit, Occupy Philly returns to Dilworth
Tuesday, November 22, 2011


PHILADELPHIA - November 17, 2011 (WPVI) -- Commissioner Charles Ramsey told Action News there were no plans to move any Occupy Philly demonstrator Thursday night.
Ramsey gave the late night update shortly after John F. Kennedy Boulevard had been shut down due to protestors moving from Dilworth Plaza to Thomas Paine Plaza and back again.
It was a chaotic scene beginning around 10:15 p.m. as occupiers decided to move across the street.
""It was a bit chaotic with people going back and forth, but there were no injuries, it was peaceful,"" Ramsey said.
Once over at Paine Plaza, the occupiers were met by a group of officers that said they needed to head back due to a lack of a permit.
""Apparently during a general assembly meeting, it was decided for an impromptu move over to Paine Plaza at MSB; there's no permit for this site. We're trying to work with the protestors to find an alternative once they do vacate Dilworth Plaza so the construction can resume. They did voluntarily vacate and go back over to Dilworth Plaza,"" Ramsey explained.
Ramsey said the move was unexpected because the arrangements are still being discussed between City Hall and the protestors.
Mayor Michael Nutter told Action News' Jim Gardner Wednesday night, there has been no permit application signed by the City of Philadelphia.
The Mayor and Occupy Philly have not agreed on any of the conditions that would be in effect once a move takes place from Dilworth Plaza to Thomas Paine.
The Mayor told Jim he is concerned over health conditions and does not want to see the conditions that exist now in Dilworth Plaza repeated once a move is taken across the street.
With no permit, the occupiers returned to the Dilworth Plaza where they have been situated for 43 days.
""Until the City decides, working with the protest groups, for now they will stay at Dilworth Plaza, but of course, obviously, they're going to have to leave that spot because construction is going to start soon,"" Ramsey said.
On Wednesday, the city ordered the protesters to leave the site immediately so that the $50 million renovation work could begin at Dilworth Plaza.
""This project's commencement is imminent,"" the statement said. ""Accordingly, you should take this opportunity to vacate Dilworth Plaza and remove all of your personal belongings immediately.""
The project, mostly paid for by federal and state grants, would replace concrete surfaces with public green space, improve access to the disabled, and revamp the transit system concourses. It would also put in a cafe that would remain lighted at night, a partially tree-covered lawn that could be used for concerts and a programmable fountain that could be turned off to allow other uses, such as ice skating, concerts or outdoor markets.
Mayor Michael Nutter says delay of the renovation project would stand in the way of more than 1,000 jobs, and tents need to move for the maintenance work.
""It's my understanding there have been discussions including today about where the relocation will take place,"" Ramsey said.
Ramsey dispelled the rumor that the relocation would take place this night.
""My understanding, there was some rumor going around we were going to do that and that's simply not true. You see all the policeman here today, simply because of the actions that took place earlier,"" Ramsey said.
Ramsey was referring to Occupy Philadelphia demonstrators marching through downtown and stopping at the Market Street bridge, blocking traffic in the process, as part of a nationwide ""day of action."" 24 people were arrested.
""All in all we had some arrests earlier today, but these are people that want to be arrested. It was peaceful, it was no problem at all,"" Ramsey said.
Jody Dodd, a member of Occupy Philadelphia's legal collective, said she's gotten a sense that support is growing for the idea to move, especially after members heard the concerns of union leaders.
""Labor has been with us from the beginning,"" Dodd said. ""The labor movement's concerns are our concerns.""
The demonstration overall is aimed at condemning the influence of big corporations on government, protesting economic disparity and showing solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York.
Earlier in the day, several members interrupted a session of Philadelphia City Council, expressing concern over issues including the city's new youth curfew law.
""So far, we've been able to have some lines of communication, I just hope that continues,"" Ramsey said.",1,Philadelphia,2011-11-22

Against ""Corporate Greed""
Protesters are critical of politicians in Washington and Harrisburg.
Several hundred people rallied outside Philadelphia City Hall on Thursday as part of an Occupy Philadelphia rally modeled after the ongoing protest on Wall Street in New York.
The crowd began gathering on Thursday morning and swelled through the noon hour.
The event on Dilworth Plaza was a mix of of speakers, demonstrators carrying signs, chanting and some musicians. An afternoon march was planned around City Hall, with police on standby to temporarily stop traffic in Center City.
Organizers said Thursday's demonstration is meant to be a stand by every day Americans against corporate greed and the elected officials who they believe support it.
“We are the 99 percent, said Steve Ross, Occupy Philadelphia organizer. “We are the ones who do not have the power anymore in this country and we need to take it back.”
Ross said the goal is to be peaceful throughout the entire event. The organizers said they have obtained the proper permits and they’ve kept an open line of communication with police.
A large police force was assembled to keep order. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey did a walk through on Thursday morning.
The group remained peaceful and as of 7:30 p.m. no on was arrested, according to police.
A tri-state Tea Party coalition issued a statement on Thursday denouncing the tactics of the Occupy Philadelphia effort.
"" While supporting the free speech rights of all, including Occupy Wall Stree t and Occupy Philadelphia, the coalition members roundly deplore the illegal tactics they employ, including sit-ins that interfere with the free flow of traffic,"" said the statement. The release included a reference to arrests of Occupy Wall Street demonstrators on the Brooklyn Bridge last Saturday.
The release said the Tea Party coalition represents American Sheepdogs, UNITEPA, Diamond State Tea Party, Cherry Hill (NJ) Area Tea Party, and the Independence Hall Tea Party.

A small group of people are going to hold this port, this city, this economy hostage. It's not fair to the workers. It is not fair to this city. This city has been very generous to the 99 percent movement. This city has been very supportive.""
She called on protesters to ""think about the consequences"" of their protest, especially as a group is threatening to shut down a 3 a.m. shift.
""The people who are planning to stay at the port -- do they have families who have trucks that because of the slowdown in the economy may lose those trucks? A day's pay -- $600, $700 -- could be the difference as to whether they can keep that truck or not.
""People have to think about who are they hurting. They are saying, 'We want to get the attention of the ruling class.' Well, I think the ruling class is probably laughing, and people in this city will be crying this Christmas. It's really got to stop.""
Interim Police Chief Howard Jordon reminded demonstrators that ""while peaceful forms of expression and free speech rights will be facilitated, acts of violence, property destruction and overnight lodging will not be tolerated.""
Port of Oakland officials said that terminals are sticking to their regular schedules with no truck or gate operations planned for Monday night.
Quan urged participants in the protests to respect workers who are trying to get home from the port and maintain safety and security, and avoid violence or damage to maritime area facilities.
10 p.m. Crowd moves to APL Terminal
About 200 remaining protesters have migrated from the Hanjin terminal on Middle Harbor Road to the APL terminal. Three tents have been pitched in the road, and protesters are eating and relaxing while still vowing to wait and regroup for a planned shut down of the 3 a.m. shift at some terminals.
9:30 p.m. Less than 100 remain at Hanjin terminal
At the Port of Oakland, the mood is festive as people dance to music from a truck with a sound system, chat and mill around. Many are now walking east down Middle Harbor Road out of the port and say they plan to go home to eat, sleep and warm up and the return at 1:30 a.m. to gear up for a 3 a.m. blockage. It's not clear how many plan to do that.
Meanwhile, organizers are directing people to go to the APL terminal near the Adeline bridge and for supporters to bring supplies there. Organizers say they plan a march from 7th and Adeline streets at 12:45 a.m.
8:50 p.m. Mayor Jean Quan speaks out against continuing protest
At a press briefing earlier, Mayor Jean Quan said she had planned to thank everyone for being peaceful, until she found out that protesters planned to continue blocking the Port of Oakland into Tuesday morning.
""The economic violence is just not fair,"" she said. ""The people who are planning to stay at the port, do they have family who have trucks? ... People have to think about who they are hurting.
""I think the 1 percent are probably laughing and people in this city are crying,"" Quan said.
Interim Police Chief Howard Jordan said police plan to monitor protesters' activity Monday evening and into Tuesday morning and take ""appropriate action"" at the right time.
Regular activity continues inside the port, but with no unloading or trucking, said Port of Oakland Executive Director Omar Benjamin.
There are three ships berthed at the port that were not unloaded Monday because of the strike; the plan is to unload them Tuesday, he said.
""Operations at the port's seven terminals experienced disruptions and delays,"" Benjamin said. ""(Monday's) disruptions have been costly to port workers and their families.""
Oakland police had not yet made any mutual aid calls Monday, Jordan said. However, some Alameda County Sheriff's deputies were called in advance to assist. The city will pay those costs, he said.
8:15 p.m. Protesters asking for help, supplies, food, blankets
About 1,000 protesters remain at the Port, but only about 100 have indicated that they are willing to stay until 3 a.m. to try and shutdown the early morning shift. Protesters have put out a call to supporters asking for warm clothes, food and blankets as they continue the protest into the night and early hours of the morning.
Meanwhile, reporters at the Hanjin terminal are having trouble finding people willing to be interviewed by what they call the ""corporate media."" One radio reporter says a protester urinated on the news van, then swore at them while telling them to ""get lost.""
7:45 p.m. General assembly decides to block 3 a.m. shift
The Occupy Oakland general assembly has decided, without a vote, to continue the Port of Oakland blockage for the 3 a.m. Tuesday shift. The decision was based on claims that Occupy movements on the West Coast faced arrests and stun grenades Monday.
However, many Occupy protesters appear not willing to stay until 3 a.m. The group is now attempting to determine how many people want to stay and how many want to leave.
7 p.m. Trucks being loaded at Howard Terminal
While Port of Oakland activity seems halted elsewhere, work is still under way at one Port of Oakland terminal. Workers are loading and unloading trucks at the Howard Terminal near Jack London Square. At the Hanjin Terminal, the Occupy Oakland group is holding its general assembly to decide whether to extend the blockade until 3 a.m. Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Port of Oakland and city officials will brief the media about the day's events at 8 p.m.
6 p.m. General assembly to decide on blockade
A large crowd has gathered at Hanjin shipping, terminals 55 and 66. A general assembly will be held to determine whether to extend the port blockade until the next shift, at 3 a.m.
There's a dozen trucks waiting to get in; the first one has a load of meat from Kansas. Its driver, Lee Ranaldson, said he'd probably lost $1,000 today.
""The ones they are fighting against are at home. They already made their money today,"" he said.
5:30 p.m. People climb atop semitrucks
The march has arrived at the Hanjin terminal. There's a line of blocked semi trucks in the middle of the road, and a half dozen people have climbed on top of one of them. There are seven TV trucks and helicopters, but still no police presence.

Hundreds of protesters have left Frank Ogawa Plaza for the Port of Oakland, chanting, ""Whose street? Our street.""

3:45 p.m. Davis, Olsen speak at rally
Civil rights activist Angela Davis is helping to get protesters warmed up before the 4 p.m. march to the port. Scott Olsen, a 24-year-old Iraq War veteran who suffered a serious head injury when protesters said he was hit with a tear-gas canister during a clash with police in October, also addressed the crowd.
""It's a great day to be out here for my first event,"" Olsen said. ""I look forward to marching with you and joining you once again. ... Stay peaceful, stay safe, and let's do some real action.""
Hundreds of people are gathered at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza in front of Oakland City Hall.

Occupation of Providence is underway
Hundreds rally against corporate greed
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) - The protests that started on Wall Street have made their way to Providence.
Hundreds of people have converged on Burnside Park in the capital city. Organizers of Occupy Providence say they want to give voice to disenfranchised Rhode Islanders, and fight back against what they see as corporate greed.
The rally quickly evolved into a march through the city. Many protesters carried signs reading ""We are the 99%"". They claim they'll stay camped in the park for as long as it takes to change environment on Wall Street, and in Washington, DC.
""99 percent of us don't make a million dollars a year, don't have one million in assets. It seems to many people that the system design is controlled by that 1 percent,"" Jared Paul of Providence told Eyewitness News.
Unofficial estimates put the crowd around 400 people.
""It's not just young kids here. The 99 percent, it's every age and every nationality. I just want people to wake up,"" Kina King of Narragansett said.
Providence police say they respect the people's constitutional right to assembly, but will only allow them in the park for 48 hours. After that, the Occupy Providence movement will need a permit from the city.",1,Providence,2011-10-16

SACRAMENTO, CA - The Sacramento City Council Tuesday night decided against a request by ""Occupy Sacramento"" protestors to lift restrictions at Cesar Chavez Plaza to allow for 24 hour occupation for demonstrations.

At least 35 police vehicles could be seen around the park and several dozen officers appeared to be involved.

Protestors To Defy Police Orders About Personal Belongings In Civic Center Plaza


Members of Occupy San Diego set up about 25 tents in Civic Center Plaza on Monday, but it was a far cry from a return to the tent city days of past weeks.
Numerous tents were set up throughout the plaza after the Occupy San Diego movement began Oct. 7, but police twice swept in and had them taken down.
In a statement to the media earlier today, Occupy San Diego spokesman Mike Garcia said the tents would return, but did not indicate they would be miniature versions. The tents, about two feet in diameter and made from cloth and wire, elicited laughter from supporters.
The protesters asked San Diego police Assistant Chief Boyd Long if they would be cited if they left the tents up in the plaza during their committee meetings, and he said no citations would be given out. His response resulted in cheers from the protesters, several of whom shook his hand.
Occupy San Diego members marched into the plaza carrying the mini-tents and chanted their manifesto, which included the phrase, ""These tents are symbols of our reoccupation.""
Garcia said they took the action in response to the arrest of a disabled member of the group on Thanksgiving morning, and in solidarity with Occupy movements in other cities and with protesters in Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt.
Long and other police officials have said since the movement began that the protesters could demonstrate in the plaza but not set up tents.",1,SanDiego,NA

Occupy San Diego protesters were expected to demonstrate outside a downtown Wells Fargo Bank branch today. The move comes one day after a few dozen protestors moved from the Civic Center Plaza, where they had been since Oct. 7, to outside a Bank of America branch office to decry the conduct of banks, corporations, political elites and political power brokers.
About 1:30 p.m. Thursday, Bank of America on B Street closed four and a half hours early due to the 30 to 40 Occupy protestors who sat in a loose circle in front of the branch, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.
San Diego police Capt. Mark Jones told the newspaper that the protest was allowed to continue because no one's bank access was being restricted and the protesters were in areas open to the public.
Protester Kevin Rambo, 18, told the Union-Tribune that his group aimed to call attention to the Occupy movement, which began in New York last month and has since spread nationwide. The fact that the branch closed early was a secondary benefit, he said.
The Wells Fargo Bank branch slated to be targeted today is also on B Street.
The Occupy movement in San Diego has been largely confrontation-free, with only two protestors being arrested for allegedly delaying police officers as they attempted to remove makeshift camp sites from the Civic Center Plaza last Friday.
Protesters have vowed to remain in the downtown area until their demands are met or at least sincerely considered. Those demands include ending joblessness, poverty and political corruption.

Lines of officers in riot gear moved the protesters off the property overnight

A total of 51 Occupy San Diego protesters were arrested early Friday morning and two more were arrested later in the day.
San Diego Police Officers and San Diego County Sheriff's Deputies cleared out Occupy San Diego protesters in the raid Friday at about 2 a.m.
The law enforcement officers arrived in riot gear to clear out the people and the tents that have taken over this space for three weeks. Forty individuals were arrested in front of Civic Center Plaza on Third St. and later, police arrested 11 additional protesters in Children's Park in downtown San Diego moments later.

When an officer using a bullhorn demanded the group disperse, protesters responded chanting ""This is what democracy looks like.""
Members of the public and employees in nearby buildings complained to the police of human and animal feces, drug use and litter on the premises. That, in addition to the numerous violations of city codes and state laws, led police to their decision, said Assistant Chief of Police Boyd Long at a Friday morning press conference.
""The driving factor was the unsanitary conditions,"" Long said.
After the press conference at the SDPD headquarters, members of the occupation gathered and chanted that they wanted their people back.
Prior to the late-night raid, police said they made efforts to mediate with protestors, utilizing professional mediators from the National Conflict Resolution Center to try to reach an agreement. Long said despite these attempts, protesters were unwilling to move their private posessions from the public property.
""These are not the kind of negotiations we’re used to – with this leaderless group,"" said San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne at the press conference during a question and answer session.
Police attempted to move the tents out of the Civic Center Plaza occupation on Oct. 14, resulting in two arrests. Since then, several tents were moved back in, and many protesters slept on the plaza at night.
“We chose the night we did because we figured there would be the smallest number of people there,” Long said.
Many of those who watched the police action were screaming that the officers were part of the 99% and singing patriotic songs.
Abraham Roloff with Occupy San Diego explained his experience just after midnight in Children's Park where he was camping overnight as part of the movement:
""They gave us no verbal warning whatsoever, they grabbed anybody who stood in their way even if their hands were up, threw them to the ground and arrested them. we asked repeatedly if we could have a few minutes to collect our personal belongings and they had nothing to say, absolute silence,"" said Roloff.
Long said police did give two verbal warnings before moving to arrest the protesters. At that point, a few protesters moved out, but many stayed.
More Raw Video: Warning Graphic Language
Occupy San Diego participants said the arrests were unfair and claimed police brutality for arresting observers and protesters. Lansdowne said he witnessed no force issues.
“There was one young woman who was simply filming them with her iPhone and they reached out, grabbed her arm, put it behind her back and arrested her without any kind of warning,” said one witness.
Officers later erected water-filled barriers around the Civic Center to keep people out of the area. They will be cleaning the plaza, and say protesters can return once they finish cleaning -- but cannot move their property back in.
Protesters say they are seeking out a privately-owned piece of land to continue their stand against corporate greed and income disparities in the country.
In response, San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders said the actions taken by police were justified.
""The City of San Diego, of course, supports anyone’s right to protest. However, when health and safety issues arise, or when protesters fail to comply with the law, appropriate action must be taken,"" Sanders said in a statement.
Kevin Keenan, Executive Director of the ACLU, spoke with Landsdowne Friday afternoon and voiced his concerns
""I urged the chief to drop the charges, release the protesters, and find an alternative space and way to accommodate overnight protest activity,"" he said in a statement,"" Keenan wrote in a statement.
SDPD confirms that later in the day two more protesters were arrested.
One person was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon after police said they threw a can at an Sgt., hitting them in the face. The Sgt. was not injured. Another person was arrested for battery.

Occupy San Francisco protesters arrested after taking over Bank of America;
Police arrested scores of anti-Wall Street protesters in San Francisco on Wednesday after they occupied a Bank of America branch in the city's financial district.
Demonstrators flooded into the bank during an organised march that began at the protesters' downtown encampment and ended at a state office building a few blocks away.
The group set up a tent inside the bank branch as more than 100 bystanders watched from outside and police in riot helmets arrested the occupiers one by one, bringing them to a waiting bus.
One protester waved a sign inside that read ""make banks pay."" Another held up a sign to a local television station that said they were protesting the link between California's public higher education system and the banks.
The protesters chanted ""we are the 99 per cent"" as they were arrested, alluding to the richest 1 per cent of the U.S. population that the activists say control a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth and power.
Officer Albie Esparza, a police department spokesman, said 95 demonstrators were arrested in connection with Wednesday's bank protest, most on suspicion of trespassing. He said there were ""no claims of injury on either side.""
Earlier during the march, the protesters, who carried American flags and signs and beat on drums, could be seen on a Ustream online video of the scene chanting, ""Who do you protect, who do you serve?"" at the officers.
One threw a small bunch of flowers at the feet of police.

No permits but plenty of police
By Chris Roberts
|  Wednesday, Oct 26, 2011  |  Updated 3:56 PM PDT


We'll take your money and give you permits, but that doesn't mean you can't be busted.
The message delivered by San Francisco police to Occupy San Francisco's protesters encamped at Justin Herman Plaza was clear Tuesday: the group is subject to arrest at any time.
Police chief Greg Suhr issued the warning via letter on Tuesday evening, according to the San Francisco Examiner. The campers, who have been set up in the park near The Embarcadero since early October, are violating city law by using flames to cook and by camping overnight, according to the police.
After arresting several protesters earlier in the week, police had told the Occupiers that they had no future plans to make arrests.

By: Dan Schreiber | 10/05/11 4:00 AM
SF Examiner Staff Writer


It was only a matter of time until the Occupy Wall Street movement came to one of the nation’s most renowned bastions of protest, and the local effort appears to be growing.
The so-called “General Assembly” of the Occupy SF movement has built a growing makeshift camp on Market Street this week and plan a march to the Federal Reserve Bank at noon today. The group began as a gathering of roughly 10 people camping
outside the Bank of America building on California Street on Sept. 17, t he same day the flagship encampment was set up in Zuccotti Park, two blocks north of Wall Street in New York.
Protesters march in downtown San Francisco to Wells Fargo headquarters.
The Occupy Wall Street protests have spread from Los Angeles to Boston; Chicago; Portland, Maine, and other cities. The budding anti-Wall Street movement began last month with a vague sense of grievance over the widening gap between the rich and poor in America.
But in three weeks, it has provided fuel for a broader national message of financial despair. Protesters have spoken out about the lack of jobs and opportunities. Organizers in Washington, D.C., plan a march at Freedom Plaza on Thursday to “denounce the systems and institutions that support endless war and unrestrained corporate greed.”
Brought together by social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook, participants hope the New York protests can plant the seeds of a permanent national movement.
In San Francisco, protesters initially spent about a week at the Bank of America building at 555 California St. The group then moved to Union Square until they were asked to leave after about a day. That is when they began building a semipermanent camp on Market Street, c omplete with tents and a makeshift cooking area under a blue tarp held up between trees and bushes.
As of Tuesday afternoon, about 40 people were setting up for a rainy night and some protesters said police had already asked them to move. Rob Benson, one of the protesters in his late 30s, said police asked them to get a permit from the Department of Public Works, then they were redirected to another city department, then back to the police.
“You can’t permit the right to assemble,” Benson said, adding that t he group is attempting to maintain good relations with police. “It’s a right.”
A poster being circulated by the group calls on protesters to show up at the Federal Reserve Building at noon today. The material is being distributed on the website
occupysf.com, which also is encouraging people to bring supplies for long-term camping, plus gardening equipment, art supplies, baby wipes and kiddie pools. The site also asks protesters to bring solar-powered chargers and smartphones with tethering capabilities to give the group roaming Internet access.
The scene Tuesday included casual interaction, tambourine playing, marijuana smoking and other fanfare. Tarek Mejri, 34, was cooking up a big pot of vegetable pasta, which he said was donated by a local farmers market.
“Everything you see here is donated,” Mejri said.",1,SanFrancisco,2011-10-05

Several hundred Occupy SF protesters are marching through downtown San Francisco on
Wednesday afternoon to protest cuts to public education.
Click on the photo to the right to see more pictures of the protesters at the bank.
The march, however, became disruptive after protesters stormed a Bank of America branch and refused to leave, leading to the arrest of demonstrators.
At about 2:15 p.m., at least 100 protesters rushed into a Bank of America branch on California Street near Davis Street, taking it over. They stood inside the branch chanting, ""We are the 99 percent.""
Some also pitched tents inside of the building.
At about 2:40 p.m., police ordered the protesters, some of whom had been standing on desks in the bank, to disperse.
Dozens of police officers stood outside the branch, and riot police arrived to secure the building.
Police scuffled with protesters, shoving them out of the way to access the building's doorway. Some people had been trying to exit the bank and others were blocking the officers' path as they tried to enter.
Another group of protesters left from outside of the bank and were headed toward Civic Center, but dozens of them remained inside as of 3 p.m. and had erected a tent in the middle of the floor. Some wore bandanas and some stood on desks.
Shortly before 4 p.m., police began arresting the protesters who remained inside.
The ""ReFund Public Education March"" was organized in part to protest the cancellation of the UC Board of Regents meeting in San Francisco this week.
The meeting was canceled because of fears that violent protests would occur, according to the regents.
""The 1 percent on the Board of Regents cancelled their meeting because we demanded they do the people's business,"" read a statement posted on the Occupy SF website about the march.

SF Examiner Staff Writer | Follow On Twitter @SFExMikeAldax


San Francisco cops have shown ""tremendous restraint"" in their recent scuffles with Occupy SF protesters, police Chief Greg Suhr declared Wednesday night.
During a Police Commission meeting, Suhr defended the dozens of arrests made early Wednesday during and after the 1 a.m. raid on the Justin Herman Plaza encampment.
More than 100 officers carried out the raid on the approximately 150 protesters, Officer Albie Esparza said. Later in the day, protesters attempted to reclaim the plaza and had a three-hour standoff with cops.
""We don’t have any reports, at least at this time, of any of the Occupy people being injured,"" the police chief told commissioners at the Wednesday night meeting.
Some protesters complained of injuries, but it wasn’t clear whether any were serious. Most
expressed anger that cops gave them only five minutes to pack up their belongings and leave the plaza. Suhr took issue with that sentiment.
""They were told they had five minutes, but per the computer-assisted dispatch log, it was actually close to 18 minutes that folks had to gather their belongings,"" Suhr said, adding that campers were actually given two months of warning to vacate.
Seventy-nine of the protesters left the plaza peacefully during the raid, with four resisting arrest but not causing assault or injury, Suhr said. Others were more combative, he said.
""There were three felony assaults on the officers,"" Suhr said. ""One demonstrator threw a bottle, another demonstrator threw a garbage can that injured an officer, and another demonstrator threw a metal chair that struck an officer in the face of his helmet, breaking his face shield.""
The suspect accused of hurling the metal chair, identified as Joshua Silva, 21, of Oakland, will be arraigned today on one felony count of assault with a deadly weapon, Assistant District Attorney Omid Talai said.
Also with a court date today is transient Michael Chapin, 28, the alleged garbage can thrower. He faces charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon and misdemeanor resisting a police officer, Talai said.
Police Commission President Thomas Mazzucco said the use of force is ""inherent in making an arrest.""
""The good news is, there were no debacles like Oakland or Los Angeles, or New York,"" Mazzucco said. ""There’s no major blowups.""",1,SanFrancisco,2011-12-08

Occupy Santa Cruz dismantled
SANTA CRUZ The building at 75 River St. is vacant once more and the ""Occudome"" outside the courthouse has been torn down.
Confrontations between law enforcement and Occupy Santa Cruz, along with what Occupy says is a splinter group that took over a former bank building last week, ended peacefully late Saturday and early Sunday.
A group of about 30 people who had occupied an empty River Street building since Wednesday left the building Saturday night, Santa Cruz police said. No arrests were made and police are compiling a report on damages and identifying those who were involved.
Several members of Occupy Santa Cruz said the River Street group never sought consensus from Occupy Santa Cruz.
Meanwhile, about 6:30 a.m. Sunday near Occupy Santa Cruz's encampment, about 60 county sheriff's deputies removed an ""Occudome"" tent and other belongings of Occupy Santa Cruz that had accumulated near the courthouse steps on Water Street, but made no arrests and wrote no citations. Sheriff's Lt. Craig Wilson said deputies had been meeting with some group members before clearing the area, and that while a small group initially was combative, most had been cooperative.
Wilson said deputies left behind medications, signs and other property and are streamlining the reclamation process for those items law enforcement did confiscate. He said the group was welcome to protest there, but could not camp or block access to county buildings or walkways.
Back across the river, police had been negotiating with people who took over the building that formerly housed Coast Commercial Bank at Water and River streets and then ordered them out Saturday afternoon. Authorities found the building empty when they arrived at 9:30 p.m. Saturday, police spokesman Zach Friend said. Sunday, the building's parking lot was cordoned off with yellow crime tape and a security guard stood watch.
The occupiers, who said they wanted to turn the building into a community center, had said they would leave the building by 3 p.m. Sunday, but police demanded they leave immediately, Friend said.
A group called 75 River Community Center released a statement Sunday saying the occupiers ""chose to exit the building since it became clear that police were targeting a small group of individuals not directly involved with the occupation.""
The group said in its statement, ""The police and some media have focused on Wells Fargo as the 'victim' in this scenario. ... The real injustice is people being pillaged out of homes they spent years working legitimately to obtain by an objectively greedy and inherently predatory legal entity.""
The property was bought in 2008 by Wells Fargo, which has a branch across the street. County records indicate that the building's owner is Associates 1 and Thomson Property Tax Services.
A woman leaving the building Sunday, who said she was a representative of the property owner, would say only that there was ""a lot of debris"" inside.
Police said the damage tally for the building's occupation would include law enforcement costs. Friend said charges against those involved could include trespassing, vandalism and conspiracy.
Chief Kevin Vogel said there was enough damage to arrest those inside for felony vandalism. Police say they have been documenting who's been inside the building and have several names, including a well-known anarchist.
""We'll be looking to prosecute these people to the fullest extent possible,"" Vogel said Saturday night. ""I'm quite pleased it was resolved this way. I'm sorry it had to get to this.""
Meanwhile, city leaders expressed satisfaction with the resolution of the occupation.
""I'm very pleased that we were able to resolve this without putting our officers and community at risk,"" Mayor Ryan Coonerty said. ""I appreciate the strategic leadership by our Police Department.""
The Police Department had been crafting the exit strategy since Wednesday night when they backed off of their first attempt. That night about 30 officers in riot gear surrounded the entrance of the building but were met with close to 200 protesters who were blocking the entrance, which had been barricaded from the inside with office furniture.
Police decided to regroup and develop a strategy.

Posted:   10/24/2011 01:30:39 AM PDT


SANTA CRUZ --
About 150 Occupy Santa Cruz protesters joined hands Sunday at Lighthouse Point Sunday in a human-chain demonstration against greed and inequity.
Organizers said they were showing that the local arm of Occupy Wall Street is ""united in peace and pushing for economic justice and accountability in the United States."" Event literature protested the consolidation of wealth in the hands of a few, with trillions of dollars poured into prisons and wars while vital social services are slashed.
The gathering included people of all ages and levels of involvement in the mushrooming movement. More than one participant noted they were part of the 99 percent, utilizing an Occupy slogan about the broadness of a movement for those who are not among the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.
Woody Carroll, 51, carried a flag as rode his bike up to join a short pre-chain rally. Carroll, who works in the UC Santa Cruz film and digital media department, said it's the first Occupy Santa Cruz rally he has attended.
""Like most Americans, I'm angry and I'm looking for a way to express that to express solidarity with Occupy Wall Street,"" he said. ""Our political process has been bought and sold. There is too much influence by corporations and the rich.
""It's in the fabric of Americans to protest and demand redress. You do what you can where you are.""
The demonstration began with music by the Sadza Marimba Band and a brief noon rally before the group stretched out along the railing fronting Monterey Bay, lining up toward Pelton Avenue and reaching bleachers erected for next week's Cold Water Classic. West Cliff Drive was bustling on a sunny fall day, and several motorists honked horns as they drove by.
Bonnie Loya and Lynn Martin were walking together down West Cliff when they decided to join the chain.
""It's great,"" said Martin, a 63-year-old school custodian. ""It's about time. We've been grousing about things since before Obama, and we haven't really done anything so visual. I think it's wonderful.""
Demonstrators held a series of signs that made sense only when held together. One multi-sign message talked of the ripples created by a pebble cast into a pond, while another called for campaign reform and one stated that ""all sentient beings have the right to pursue happiness and live in peace and freedom.""
Those in the chain sang several songs in unison, including ""This Land is Your Land.""
Joy Binah, 56, a Santa Cruz artist and farmer, helped organize the event.
Binah has been seeking a mortgage modification from Wells Fargo Bank since November, and said she has had to reapply every 60 days because the bank does not act on her request.
She added that she would join the movement even if she had no loan problems.
""We have 1 percent of the population controlling the remainder, and the time has come to put an end to the oppression,"" she said. ""Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could connect these groups across the United States?""
Others spoke of lost homes, lost jobs and lost faith in government.
An organizer of Occupy Santa Cruz, Noah Shepardson, said the Santa Cruz group held its first general assembly Oct. 4.
Based at the courthouse steps along Water Street with a camp in nearby San Lorenzo Park, the movement has held several marches and protests at Santa Cruz branches of national banks.
Shepardson said the human chain went well, and that more are in the works.
""It was excellent,"" he said. ""There was a really good turnout and we got a lot of good public support. I think a lot of people who spent time out there on West Cliff got at least a little glimpse of what we're about.""",1,Santa Cruz,2011-10-24

Bigger Occupy Seattle protest set for Saturday
Demonstrators took a brief break from downtown Seattle's Westlake Park on Thursday to make way for a jobs rally organized by Washington labor unions.
KING-TV (http://bit.ly/pCQUJ80) reports about 10 police officers arrived at the park around 9:30 a.m. and told about 75 demonstrators they had to leave. After a brief confrontation, the Occupy Seattle protesters left and no arrests were made.
By early Thursday afternoon, 20 Occupy Seattle supporters were back in Westlake Park.
About 25 protesters have moved to City Hall, where Mayor McGinn has said they were welcome. Midday Thursday, some joined union outside the Grand Hyatt, where GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney was holding a noon fundraiser.
Demonstrators voted Wednesday night to occupy Westlake Park indefinitely. A biggest demonstration is planned for Saturday.

Occupy Seattle calls for supporters to break up with their banks
Nationally, the movement is calling for supporters to move to community banks, credit unions
SEATTLE—
Occupy Seattle held a rally in support of National Bank Transfer Day at Westlake Park at 1 p.m. Saturday. The Occupy movement asked supporters to close their bank accounts at commercial banks and open accounts at community-based banks and credit unions.
""We can't let the fox watch the henhouse anymore,"" activist Susan Wilkinson said. ""They don't self-police and they don't behave responsibly.""
A number of supporters went into the downtown Seattle Chase bank to close their accounts. The group marched in a peaceful and orderly way. Police were present and officers did not need to intercede with the group.
Many of the protesters who transferred banks as part of the event knew for a long time beforehand that they would be making a change, but needed the motivation.
""I didn't have the energy to change and go through all of the paperwork, but as I started becoming more politically aware, I got the energy,"" Wilkinson said.
A large part of the Occupy movement has focused its criticism on large banks that many supporters believe are responsible for the current downturn. Citing the bank's ""corporate greed"" and role in the uptick in home foreclosures that have occurred over the course of the past few years, Occupy supporters believe that physically moving their monetary assets will send a message to the banks.
The message they are sending to banks is succinct: ""It's not me, it's you,"" Amelia Vasser said. She took part because of the national movement.
""I've seen them chargee me ridiculous fees, re-arrange transactions so they could charge me the most amount in overdraft things,"" Vasser said. ""I have no complaint with my branch, the complaint is with corporate arrogance, the complaint is with corporate Chase.""
On their website, Occupy Seattle posted that the group “believes that we need to support financial institutions, like local banks and credit unions, that invest in our communities, make loans to small businesses, and help create jobs. There is no reason to continue doing business with the Wall Street banks that crashed the economy and have done little to help the nation recover. Every dollar we take back goes towards building a new bottom line that means good jobs and healthy communities.”
Today's rally included performances by singer Jim Page, the trip-hop group Surrealized, America’s Got Talent alum Jen Seaman and comedians Travis Simmons and Nigel Larson.",1,Seattle,2011-11-05

Occupy Sebastopol seeks support, protests big banks
Occupy Sebastopol demonstrators put their voices, and their feet, behind the movement on Saturday.

Two days after the Santa Rosa City Council gave Occupy campers permission to remain on the lawn at City Hall if they meet a range of conditions, close to 60 marchers in Sebastopol distributed fliers at shops and offices along several blocks of downtown.
They hope business owners will post them as pre-printed statements of support in advance of a Tuesday meeting at Sebastopol City Hall over their right to camp in the central square.
“We want people to open their minds to how much change needs to happen,” said Andrew DeRoos, 21.
“The idea of holding the square is about creating the space for dialog,” said Erik Ohlsen, 32, who cut his activist teeth during demonstrations at the 1999 ministerial meetings of the World Trade Organization in Seattle. “Grassroots organizing takes time.”
The march passed the branches of several national banks, where supporters pumped their fists and chanted their dissatisfaction with traditional financial institutions. A few exuberant demonstrators shouted directly at a woman who was trying to exit the Bank of America, until another supporter persuaded them to back off.
Otherwise, there were no confrontations as the group walked along downtown sidewalks, followed intermittently by a police sergeant who tailed them in his patrol car and later thanked the group for “how you conducted your business.”
It was their second Sebastopol march. The first one, last Saturday in the rain, marked the start of Occupation Sebastopol in solidarity with a nearly two-month-old demonstration in New York’s Wall Street area protesting the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of corporations and the nation’s wealthiest one percent.
Though only a few people have been staying the night in three or four tents erected in the northeast corner of the Sebastopol plaza, the city has alerted Occupy supporters that staying there violates city ordinance.
They were given a 20-page permit application Wednesday evening that’s supposed to be completed by Tuesday, several members said.
But it’s not at all clear what the consensus for handling the city’s demand will be.
As part of the cross-pollination that’s occurring between demonstrators in different cities, Ben Browner, an Occupy Santa Rosa participant who helped negotiate a permit obtained last week for camping at Santa Rosa City Hall, urged his Sebastopol counterparts to make a good faith effort to meet the Tuesday deadline and avoid forcing the council’s hand on enforcing the ordinance.
Occupy Sebastopol members are to hold a general assembly meeting today Sunday to discuss how to proceed.
One supporter, Chris Rockwell, 33, said it makes no sense for an individual to accept responsibility and liability for the entire group by taking out the permit in his or her name.
Rockwell said he’s working to get the group incorporated so the permit can be obtained by the corporate entity — though that would require additional time and the patience of the city council, he said.
Rockwell said the group, meanwhile, was trying to be respectful in its use of the plaza, prohibiting alcohol, for example, and planning Sunday to move the tents to another portion of the square to spare the grass excess wear.
Ohlsen, who owns a local permaculture consulting and sustainable landscaping business, plans to hold ecological base camp design training in Sebastopol on Tuesday for Occupy supporters.
“Our intent is to work with the city in as cooperative a way as we can,” said Sebastopol resident Linus Lancaster, a Healdsburg High School art teacher and Navy veteran who has supported Occupy encampments in Santa Rosa and Sebastopol.
Lancaster said he joined the Occupy Wall Street movement “because it’s the first political movement I’ve seen that in broad terms understands the issues America is facing in a systemic way.”
“I’ve been waiting for the revolution for four years,” 88-year-old Geneva Folsom said. “This is the first time I’ve been passionate about getting out and fighting for something.”
The marching, chanting and camping out is just the beginning of a process aimed at raising awareness, engaging large numbers and reaching consensus on common goals, demonstrators said.
In Santa Rosa, junior college business student Frank Anderson, 19, said he’d camped out at Santa Rosa City Hall for nearly a month and now thinks of it as home.
When the lease on his apartment is up Jan. 21, he plans to give it up altogether since he’s living out front of City Hall to support the occupation.
“When this goes down in the history books,” he said, “it’s going to go right next to the Civil Rights movement.”

Peaceful eviction for Occupy Tacoma campers
SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL
LENGTH: 136 words
DATELINE: TACOMA Wash.


The last five or six Occupy Tacoma demonstrators finished packing up Monday morning and cleared out of Pugnetti Park.
The land is owned by the state Transportation Department, which posted eviction notices Thursday because of liability issues. About 20 people had been camping there since October.
The Tacoma campers left peacefully, in contrast to Occupy demonstrators who clashed with police in other cities.
One, Cameron Ruba, proudly carried an eviction notice he had signed by Transportation Department workers and State Patrol troopers with ""best wishes."" He says campers were treated civilly so they dealt civilly with the request to leave.
Another camper, Bret Johnson, said Occupy Tacoma would continue to have weekly meetings.
Three others headed for the bus station, planning to head south to join Occupy San Diego.

497,7721,"Joe Redner: ""I think I should pay more taxes""
6:21 PM, Dec 18, 2011
Written by Ashley Porter                 


TAMPA, Fla. -- Joe Redner's the man behind a lot of Tampa businesses - perhaps none more famous than the Mons Venus strip club.
""They undertax the rich and I'm one of them,"" he says. ""I'm one of the one percent and I think I should pay more taxes. They use the excuse that there won't be jobs if we tax the rich. The money that I leave in my business they don't tax.""
That's why he's lending a hand, and the park he owns in West Tampa, to the Occupy movement.
""They're feeding people in the park. I just love that to death that they're helping people,"" Redner said on Saturday.
On Saturday, Occupy Tampa set up for the first time in Voice of Freedom Park, offering food and clothing donations to the surrounding neighborhood in collaboration with Food Not Bombs.
""It's all of us who didn't know each other two months ago, so it's really exciting to think about the possibility that this could happen anywhere,"" said David Morris, who works with Occupy Tampa's media team.
Jonathan Skinner first joined the Occupy movement in Dallas, then headed to Austin, New Orleans, Gainesville and, finally, Tampa. He sees Occupy Tampa as a solid movement that, especially in the wake of dozens of arrests over the last two months, has lacked a true public space to spread its message.
""The fact is they don't have a park,"" Skinner says. ""Their resilience here is amazing.""
That's why even though Voice of Freedom Park isn't truly being occupied - it's more of a community gathering space for the movement - it still helps Occupy Tampa greatly. They can use it to help the community while figuring out what direction their movement goes next.
""Now we're kind of at the stage where we have to really buckle down, decide what we're about, and start accomplishing things,"" Morris says.
And they're happy to have Redner's support behind them.
""What we need to do is get this country on the right footing by taxing the people that can afford to pay the tax and helping the people that don't have the jobs,"" Redner says.

498,7899,"Occupy Tulsa rallies for accused hit man
Updated: 12/09/2011 11:31 am Published: 12/08/2011 9:29 pm




Occupy Tulsa rallied in support of an accused hit man’s constitutional rights Thursday evening.
Terrico Bethel is accused of gunning down Tulsa businessman Neal Sweeney at his east Tulsa office, in September of 2008. It’s a hit prosecutors say was planned by Mohammad Aziz, a north Tulsa gas station owner, who didn't want to pay Sweeney for fuel delivery.


Usually occupiers are out at Centennial Green near 6 th and Main Street, but for a few hours close to 50 people stood outside the David L. Moss Correctional Center unafraid of backlash this rally could bring their way.
Occupiers say this not about whether Bethel is guilty or innocent.
“I know for a fact he has rights that are being denied of him,” Chris Nichols said.
When asked to elaborate, Nichols said, “it’s not necessarily right that he’s been detained for what’s been going on three years.”
Supporting Bethel’s sixth amendment right to a speedy trial is a move that’s sure to fire up the opposition.  It’s something not even Bethel’s mother expected.
“(I was) very shocked, very surprised, very pleased, I mean, I am still kind of overwhelmed by it,” Glenda Gray said.


The people behind Occupy Tulsa say their mission is broader than just eliminating corporate greed in Tulsa and across the globe.
“We’re willing to devote what resources we have to social justice,” Nichols said.
No matter whom Nichols says they offend, inspire, or alarm.
“We have the obligation as a society to advocate for justice whether or not we are socially degraded for it.”
They just want Bethel out of a jail cell and into a court room.
“If he is connected to the crime, and if he did commit the murder he should experience that due process,” Nichols told FOX23.
District Attorney Tim Harris wouldn’t comment on camera, but he says the reason Bethel’s trial keeps getting delayed is that Bethel has had repeated issues with his lawyers.
Bethel’s mother however says her son’s first lawyer left the case after more complicated charges were added, and a second lawyer left when additional funds for the Bethel’s legal defense were not approved.


Court paperwork does show that six weeks ago, Bethel fired his attorney once again pushing his trial back. He is scheduled to be in court for a pretrial hearing on December 14th.",1,Tulsa,2011-12-09
499,8047,"Occupy Freedom Plaza Rolls Into Second Day
7:07 PM, Oct 7, 2011                                           |                   



WASHINGTON, DC (WUSA) -- This city has seen plenty of protests far bigger than the Occupy anti-war and ""anti-corporate greed"" protests.
But one difference is these demonstrators plan to camp on Freedom Plaza on Pennsylvania Avenue day and night -- a bit like the Bonus Army in the depths of the depression.
And they say they're staying until the country starts changing for the better.
Waving flags and carrying a giant banner with the preamble to the Constitution, hundreds of protestors left Freedom Plaza to march across the National Mall. ""I'm here to protest all the violence in the world. And since my time in Vietnam, it just never stops,"" said a vet who would only give his name as Jim.
This is the first protest for some of them. ""I was a medical transcriptionist for thirty years,"" says Tina Strobel, an unemployed worker from Kansas City. ""So what are you doing now?"" I asked her. ""This!"" she replied, wading into the march.
Some are promising civil disobedience. A few invaded the Washington offices of drone maker General Atomic. But there have been no arrests -- the police are going out of their way to escort the marches.
Even some of the people caught in traffic are supportive. ""Free speech, right?"" ""It's great."" ""Help people.""
Activists who've struggled for decades to create a left wing populist movement say they've never been so excited. ""People are out of their chairs, off the sofas, in the streets, organizing around principals. Not behind candidates,"" said David Swanson of October2011.org.
Even failed presidential candidate Ralph Nader is impressed. ""It's very hard to marginalize the 99% of the people who think the corporate state and the corporate power system is unfair.""
The protestors seem to have a million different agendas. The signs include ""Stop The Pipeline,"" ""End The War,"" and ""Human Need, Not Corporate Greed.""
Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve... and President Obama at the White House... have both talked about the Occupy demonstrators in the last few days. And the mainstream media has probably not paid as much attention to leftist activists in decades. Organizers are convinced they're having an impact.

Singer gets to occupy D.C. cell
SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C02
LENGTH: 194 words
 
Raheem DeVaughn says he didn't set out to commit civil disobedience Sunday - he planned only to hear Cornel West speak to the Occupy D.C. protest. But one thing led to another, and the Grammy-nominated crooner got himself arrested, along with West and 17 other protesters, for refusing to leave the steps of the Supreme Court. They were released a day later - no fines, no charges.
So, jail - how was it? Not bad, the Prince George's native told our colleague Aaron Leitko. ""It was pretty by-the-book, standard procedure,"" he said over the phone. The police were ""pretty pleasant,"" for the most part. ""They had one bad apple out of the crew."" Oooh, what did he do? Well, nothing, really. ""It was just his energy, man,"" DeVaughn said. ""It could be that he was missing the football game. It was a Sunday.""
Any star-struck cellmates? ""I won't say star-struck, but people definitely knew who we were,"" he said. ""We got an opportunity to build with a lot of the brothers and for the young cats to see us and embrace us.""
And, yes, he'd totally do it again. ""My team will probably hate to hear this, but this may not be the last time I go to jail for a thing that matters.""

501,8297,"Occupy Youngstown Protests At Hubbard Well Site
Published: 12/21/2011 12:43 pm                 
Updated: 12/21/2011 11:30 pm
                                         
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources has a permit request for construction of what's called a brine injection well off Masury Road near Interstate 80 in Hubbard Township.
That's where Occupy Youngstown members staged a protest with their message: There's too many unknowns for the project to happen.
""The rights of the people have just gone away. We have no say,"" said Occupy Youngstown member John Williams.
Williams and a group of protestors held signs against fracking and an injection well that could soon be located on Masury Road off Route 62. D & L Energy would drill the well.
""These chemicals never go away. Once those toxins are in our ground, they're here forever,"" Williams said.
The brine well, thousands of feet deep, is where a company would dispose of fluids from the oil and natural gas drilling process. ODNR said there's nearly 150,000 of these types of wells in the United States.
Williams said he feels enough isn't known about fracking and the fluids that eventually have to be disposed. For him, current regulations aren't tough enough.
""Fracking and the gas companies have had the laws changed since 2005 to benefit themselves,"" Williams said.
""Our government officials aren't listening to us. They're out for the money, and that's a big concern for me,"" said Chris Khuprakob of Occupy Youngstown.
Khumprakob was not at last week's public meeting where an ODNR representative shared information and answered questions, but she stands firm that there's not been enough long-term information gathered and analyzed.
""I think we need to study it more before we start fracking all over Ohio,"" she said.
Although the group wants the entire process banned, they realize the likeliness of that happening is slim.
""The more people that stand against this the better the chances we have of banning it,"" Williams said.
The township has requested a moratorium on the construction of the well, but there is no word on any action yet. As for the permit request, it's still in the hands of ODNR.
Williams said his opposition to fracking doesn't mean he's not for bringing new jobs to the region.
""We'd like to replace it with clean industry,"" Williams said.
